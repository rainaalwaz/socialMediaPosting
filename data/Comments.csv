ppl flipakrt is a fraud website   cheating customers   my frneds gave 3flipakrt egvs which he got from payzippy and i use them on their site and placing a order  but after 1 day they cancelled my order   they took my egvs and rest of money i paid for free shipping  flipkart says ur egvs are illegal they cant b transferable to u  
ppl my frnd got these egvs from PAYZIPPY COM where they clearly mentioned these r tranferable and flipkart will be no responisible for stolen or lost egvs  
Y they bothered how i got egvs it s not their problem and 2nd thing they keep telling me only my friend can use it but egvs are transferable 
when i contacted them on phone and email they said our legal team is working on it and it will be clear to you in 1 2days but its been 4 5days they kept telling me the same thing and now stop replying my mails too   

so beware guys dont buy anything from flipkart com  if any of u dont believe it then i can also show gmail conversations    ?#+@2013 12 26T00:52:13+0000"

My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:03:17+0000no good deals   sorry to say  but you are fooling us   you have in fact increased prices of the books    disappointed   : (?#+@2013 12 20T20:35:51+0000sali ghatiya website     kyu offer dete ho agar kuch dena hi ni hota    ghar baitho apne ja k     close kar do is website ko     ghatiya log ghatiya website       order confirm kar k order cancel kar dia   khood ki sarkar bna rakhi h      doob maaro        isko to banned kar do koi internet se      never purchase anything from this bad website

Beware  flipkart is as fraudulent a website as you will possibly get 
Their modus operandi works like this > If you place an order they will create 4 5 orders of the same or different type and will start debiting your account for such fake orders  They shamelessly say they have customer support but they dont   try it yourself  I called more than 100 times and each time someone picks and cuts the line  You will then be running all over the world to get your money back for which they will never be contactable
I suffered this ordeal after they fraudulently generated dozen orders from my account and started debiting my account  ANd it is weeks since I am still waiting for a refund for which again they are not going to take any responsibility as will then coolly say that the issue is related to bank and they did not do anything
Fraudsters are of many kinds     and FLipkart is the latest one on the block  Never ever go to their website   you will get totally ripped off as I have experienced?#+@2014 07 02T05:24:37+0000Flipkart the cheatcart

My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:05:04+0000Order Number OD31202015633

This is a review I wrote about a product I had ordered from Flipkart  For some reasons  Flipkart doesn t seem to take criticism well  They asked me to edit it (based on their policy) and since I refused  they simply deleted it  On the other end  they leave reviews that also infringe their policies  but this time  these reviews are singing praises about their services (i e  comments on the Flipkart service per se  like they were fast  etc   )  Beware of Flipkart corporate policies and strategies  as they seem to carefully polish their facade

Flipkart services go down in south

I have lived many years in north India and placed several orders with Flipkart  So far  I ve always been pleased with the fast and reliable service offered  Until  until    I recently moved to the south and started placing more orders to discover that the delivery system here is far from efficient and reliable  to say the least 

I recently had a very unpleasant experience  The delivery person was grossly incompetent and aggressive  The worst part which made me refuse and return the parcel is that the box was damaged and one item had been stolen  If they use EKARTL as delivery partner in your area  this means you might be up for some troubles too      

My order was canceled by Flipkart today  I was asked to place the order again (as I still want the product )  but the price had gone up in the meanwhile  After being told that I would have to pay the new price and me asking to have a chat with a manager  they finally offered me to refund the difference in my Flipkart wallet (although it will take 24 hours) for me to finally place the order again at the old price  Still following the process??? In the end  this make this purchase very unpleasant and introduces lots of delays  Flipkart  I think it s high time to review your policy with your delivery partner EKARTL as they don t seem as effecient as in the north

Dear Avisek 

Greetings from Flipkart 

This mail is further to the telephonic conversation we had a while ago 

The concern raised with us earlier was that you had received a phone which had an ICS update  
when you had paid in advance for a phone which had a Jelly bean OS 

We received your concern on this over 2 months post the purchase and you have informed that you were abroad and this is raised after your return 

We put this across to our team internally for an update  We have received an update informing that the workaround for this is that the mobile phone could be taken to authorized service centre and can be upgraded to Jelly bean OS free of cost 

However  as this is unacceptable from your end and that the expectation set is you either want a phone with the latest OS or a refund 

We are checking with our team internally on this and should be able to provide a further update  We request your kind cooperation in this regard and thank you for patience shown 
                                                                             
2nd  Update on 30th October 2013 : Very very bad service from flipkart: Very disappoitining:

Hi flipkart com team  I got a call on October 24th and was assured that I will get a call back in 2days The person told that he will check with the back end team and check why this mishap happened I told that I am ready to send pictures of my packaged box with the IEMI number as a proof  He told that the pictures are not required  Today nearly a week has passed  no further call/mail/post from flipkart   I need a reply on (Order ID: OD30802021212) and your corrective action on this  I need the product as advertised on the website( Lava IRIS 501 with JB installed) I strongly object to sending me an older/different product (Lava iris 501 with ICS)  I am fine with to get the correct product (Lava IRIS 501 with JB) or a refund   But I want a reply /call/ from flipkart  I am really disappointed with this attitude  Inspite of this mishap I have bought products from flipkart last week itself  I hope that flipkart truly gives service  what it promises  But things like this  just breaks my trust and faith 
                                                                               
Update : 1 Initial problem psoted on 24th October 2013: Flipkart sends a wrong mobile phone (Lava IRIS 501) (Order ID: OD30802021212)

Hi flipkart comTeam 
I have ordered Lava IRIS 501 (Order ID: OD30802021212) for a gift for my dad and have seen the information in your website that Lava IRIS 501 has got Android v4 1 (Jelly Bean) OS  Thats the reason I ordered Lava IRIS 501  I was out of India when the delivery happened and came back to India last week itself  But when I check now the handset I found that you have sent Lava IRIS 501with older Android v4 0 (ICS) version only  This is a cheating from FLipkart  I ordered IRIS 501 because it has v4 1 (Jelly Bean)   You have put the same information in your website itself but then why did you send a older set with ICS? If I would like to have an ICS model  I would taken a different mobile I took IRIS 501 only for Jelly Bean You are putting some info (JB) in your website but sending an older version (ICS)  This is really pathetic service from Flipkart  I have bought so many things from Flipkart but never expected this type of service  My father didnot have knowledge of Android version like mine so he couldnot find out But as sson as I checked I could clearly see  I want a new handset IRIS 501 with Jelly Bean installed  I donot accept the older model of ICS you have sent to me  I want the same configuration which is being advertised in your website  not a older model 
Please take correct steps to sort this out ?#+@2013 11 14T11:29:20+0000flipkart com stop updating such schemes when u cant even deliver a genuine product :/
Bought a hard disk n it was all scam    Cover had a diff  serial number and the disk had different   apparently my disk was not covered under any warranty   is this why Flipkart so great ??#+@2013 11 13T17:53:20+0000Flipkart the cheatcart
My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:14:07+0000Order ID: OD31019013665

The concern raised with us earlier was that you had received a phone which had an ICS update  
when you had paid in advance for a phone which had a Jelly bean OS 

We received your concern on this over 2 months post the purchase and you have informed that you were abroad and this is raised after your return 

We put this across to our team internally for an update  We have received an update informing that the workaround for this is that the mobile phone could be taken to authorized service centre and can be upgraded to Jelly bean OS free of cost 

However  as this is unacceptable from your end and that the expectation set is you either want a phone with the latest OS or a refund 

We are checking with our team internally on this and should be able to provide a further update  We request your kind cooperation in this regard and thank you for patience shown 
                                                                             
2nd  Update on 30th October 2013 : Very very bad service from flipkart: Very disappoitining:

Hi flipkart com team  I got a call on October 24th and was assured that I will get a call back in 2days The person told that he will check with the back end team and check why this mishap happened I told that I am ready to send pictures of my packaged box with the IEMI number as a proof  He told that the pictures are not required  Today nearly a week has passed  no further call/mail/post from flipkart   I need a reply on (Order ID: OD30802021212) and your corrective action on this  I need the product as advertised on the website( Lava IRIS 501 with JB installed) I strongly object to sending me an older/different product (Lava iris 501 with ICS)  I am fine with to get the correct product (Lava IRIS 501 with JB) or a refund   But I want a reply /call/ from flipkart  I am really disappointed with this attitude  Inspite of this mishap I have bought products from flipkart last week itself  I hope that flipkart truly gives service  what it promises  But things like this  just breaks my trust and faith 
                                                                               
Update : 1 Initial problem psoted on 24th October 2013: Flipkart sends a wrong mobile phone (Lava IRIS 501) (Order ID: OD30802021212)

Hi flipkart comTeam 
I have ordered Lava IRIS 501 (Order ID: OD30802021212) for a gift for my dad and have seen the information in your website that Lava IRIS 501 has got Android v4 1 (Jelly Bean) OS  Thats the reason I ordered Lava IRIS 501  I was out of India when the delivery happened and came back to India last week itself  But when I check now the handset I found that you have sent Lava IRIS 501with older Android v4 0 (ICS) version only  This is a cheating from FLipkart  I ordered IRIS 501 because it has v4 1 (Jelly Bean)   You have put the same information in your website itself but then why did you send a older set with ICS? If I would like to have an ICS model  I would taken a different mobile I took IRIS 501 only for Jelly Bean You are putting some info (JB) in your website but sending an older version (ICS)  This is really pathetic service from Flipkart  I have bought so many things from Flipkart but never expected this type of service  My father didnot have knowledge of Android version like mine so he couldnot find out But as sson as I checked I could clearly see  I want a new handset IRIS 501 with Jelly Bean installed  I donot accept the older model of ICS you have sent to me  I want the same configuration which is being advertised in your website  not a older model 
Please take correct steps to sort this out ?#+@2013 11 14T11:30:49+0000Dear all  its for everyone who is fastrauted because of pathatic service from flipkat and for whose complints not geting resolved

"2220","Update 3 on 14th November: Very very bad service from flipkart: Very disappoitining: sent wrong mobile (Lava IRIS 501) (Order ID: OD30802021212)

Flipkart replied me on 1st November with the follwoing mail given below:

They have confirmed though at the time of my purchase LAVA IRIS 501 was available with Jelly Bean  they have sent an older stock (with ICS)
model  They are now checking with vendor/brand how to resolve the issue 

I am still awating flipkart s reply   Does it take 2 more weeks to come back with a reply 
Also I could see that Flipkart replies only when I post something in Facebook 

I am too tired of this tactics  of flipkart and need some concrete reply 

I want want a phone with the latest OS or a refund

Ambrane P 801 P 801 (Black)

the product is received in dead condition  Dont know why you have shipped a dead product without checking  Delivered on 24th october and till now it is not being picked up  informed the flipkart the same day  they just forwarded it to balaji  balaji gave the contact details of ambrane and told to call me myself  why should i call here and there for a faulty product received  The ambrane persons are totally careless even they shout at you if you are sharing your problem with them  they are totally non cooperative and working like a government office  they doesnt have to do anything with customer concerns  they will call you and give orders 

Till now the defective product is lying with me  No action has been taken by flipkart to return the product and refund my money?#+@2013 11 19T05:03:22+0000What is it with you  Prakash?

Return policy of flipkart is bogus  Their vendors are cheaters 
Flipkat?s customer protection cell is also bogus 

Order ID: OD31018062901  HP 818 Tricolor Ink Cartridge (Cyan  Magenta  Yellow)  Seller: ITsOriginal 

I ordered HP color printer Cartridge  The piece came to me is defective  When I put back the old Cartridge  that works fine  But this new one (same product id) is not detectable 
I requested for replacement  They started harassment 

They replied with a weblink of shops where I can visit and get the replacement  The whole idea of online shopping is to save travel and cost  I am a senior citizen and can?t go out and hence do online shopping  If this is criterion of return policy then whats the use of this policy? Flipkart delivers defective items to us and we send us the weblink of shops where we can return  is this a return policy?
That anyways  any branded company provides the return within the guarantee period  In that case I can get the return by directly going to HP without even bothering about Flipkar?s return policy  So whats the value addition of this policy? It doesn?t matter whether it exists or not 

When I raised above concerns with Flipkart?s resolution cell ( customer?s rights protection cell   they call it)  one standard reply comes everytime that they are investigating this 
And what they do always is reject my return request everytime with some stupid reason like return policy is valid till 10 days after the delivery (which is wrong anyway  its still 4 5 days after the delivery) 
They are very fast to close my return request everytime I raise it again ?#+@2013 10 30T05:45:09+0000So you people tweet from Singapore ?? :P?#+@2013 10 30T06:13:25+0000Don t purchase anything from flipkart android application it has some payment problem  I lost Rs 1700  Still they are keeping silent ?#+@2013 10 27T14:40:46+0000Flipkart is losing its goodwill now a days ?#+@2013 10 27T14:37:38+0000Haha    Is ur admin holidaying in Singapore??#+@2013 10 27T14:08:52+0000freat offer?#+@2013 10 27T12:03:13+0000Return policy of flipkart is bogus  Their vendors are cheaters 
Flipkat?s customer protection cell is also bogus 
EVEN THEY MADE FALSE PROMISE OF REFUNDING MY MONEY OF DEFECTIVE ITEM BUT THEN AGAIN BECOME NON RESPOSIVE

Order ID: OD31018062901  
After shouting from my lungs  they promised to refund the money  Mr Shankar and Mr Akshay spke to me and made this promise  Even I got the mail from ?Sri? that money will be refund immediately after I sent the bank detail  I sent it two days back  after that there is mysterious silence and they are not replying my money  Never heard og these kind of things earlier in my life   Flipkart is behaving like local shopkeeper and not like company  God save India? 

Find below the mail from flipkar where they promise to refund the money  
Dear Navneet

But all this has changed after my last purchase at flip kart ( Order OD31008001885)
I just order a mobile cover on 8th Oct and for last two days the status is  ?Seller yet to dispatch item from warehouse ?  How many more days you guys need to dispatch the item ?
You guys are fast in accepting the payment and so much careless/laziness in just dispatching the item  The estimated date for delivery is shown as 17 Oct  
10 days for delivery       is it acceptable ??? I stay in Bangalore not in remote area  Still so pathetic service 
Earlier you guys were very fast in delivery and service and use to deliver in 1 3 days  But that is gone now  It seems Now flip kart is no longer care for customer satisfaction  
I regret why the hell I ordered from flip kart  

This is my last order on flip kart  Neither I am not going to buy any other thing from flip kart nor I will recommend it for any one 

Worst service ever   Shame on the management on turning the once an amazing flip kart in to such a pathetic state

My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:17:08+0000Worst service ever

I have been using flip kart for over 2 year  I was always satisfied by the fast service and recommended flipchart to many of my friends and collages in past 

But all this has changed after my last purchase at flip kart ( Order OD31008001885)
I just order a mobile cover on 8th Oct and for last two days the status is  ?Seller yet to dispatch item from warehouse ?  How many more days you guys need to dispatch the item ?
You guys are fast in accepting the payment and so much careless/laziness in just dispatching the item  The estimated date for delivery is shown as 17 Oct  
10 days for delivery       is it acceptable ??? I stay in Bangalore not in remote area  Still so pathetic service 
Earlier you guys were very fast in delivery and service and use to deliver in 1 3 days  But that is gone now  It seems Now flip kart is no longer care for customer satisfaction  
I regret why the hell I ordered from flip kart  

This is my last order on flip kart  Neither I am not going to buy any other thing from flip kart nor I will recommend it for any one 

Worst service ever   Shame on the management on turning the once an amazing flip kart in to such a pathetic state

Order number: OD30910023507 
Date received:  13 Sept  2013

Its been almost a week since i got the delivery of my product and the very next day i filed a complaint with them but still no response  Every time i tried to ask about the status of my complaint they tell me to wait for 24hrs   and again and again   like this one weak has passed  I have sent around 10 emails to different deparments of their support center   NO RESPONSE     I dont know for what reason they post such ads where they promise replacement warranty and customers satistaction  Flipkart packed that product in so many wrappers that it wa hard to open but when i opened i found it defective as it didnt turn on  Flipkart doesnt guarantee the product after the package is opened  I hope so thats why they are not doing anything to resolve my problem

My second exp with you also been bad  My order number 30728053770  While I was ordering   had called and requested for a fast delivery and peron online  Kavitha  told me that I can call the next day and request  99% the order will reach by Tuesday  Pls check your call recordings on Sunday 3 pm 
Monday at 12 30 noon I called to again request for the delivery on Tuesday since kids b day is on Tuesday wish to give the kid a gift on that day  Though we got the invite at last  :) 
Monday Flipkart exp was excellent like last time   no courtesy and rude tune by  Bhanu  saying it is not possible at all Amazing supervisor  Abijith   came online and with out even having the normal customer service act  said you should have read the 2 5 business days before ordering 
I order from Jabong  zansar com  myantra and yebi  Never ever I had faced any such rude behavior

My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:24:19+0000On the reference of my order No: OD30724073129 received on the date July 26 2013 at about 1 10 pm

If you give me a price guarantee I expect to receive an Item  If you give me an estimated date  I want the product on time 

Order ID: OD30714023683?#+@2013 07 19T08:14:15+0000I ordered Philips GC1980 Iron on 15 07 2013 wide Order ID: OD30715021292 They shipped product on July 15  2013 and reached in Pune which is destination on July 16  2013 
Product was lying in the Pune depot for 2 days and I failed to understand  why after reaching the product in same city why flipkart not delivered? Delivery location was in heart of city  it is not outside city limit 
I made so many requests through mail but they were not replying and giving reason of not delivering 
I heard flipkart is very fast delivering the product very fast and before time? but they have worst customer service representative  They have set an example of how bad should be customer service? 
I will think next time while buying the product from flipkart com ?#+@2013 07 20T07:04:43+0000Flipkart the cheatcart

My name is Bhupendra Jain I have seen one advertisement from google that google is running a 3 day online shopping festival and many online shopping portals are taking part in it So through I went on flipcart com the online megastore I required 2 samsung s duos mobiles I saw the price on 11/12/2013 as it was a memorable date for me to buy some new stuff I saw the price it was 8499 rs It was really a very good price compared to  other offline and online store So while ordering it allowed me to choose quantity 1 only so I ordered twice as it was mentioned on the site that for more quantity you have to create separate order So I got my two order numbers OD31211014951 and OD31211064895 I was really feeling very happy that I am an intelligent guy and saved atleast 1000 rs buying two mobiles from flipcart I received a confirmation call from flipcart for the two order and I confirmed that yes I want 2 samsung s duos and I was assured that I will get my mobiles within next 2 to 3 days Suddenly I was shocked when I received this message on 12/12/2013 at 11 14 pm The message was  ?Your cancellation request for Flipkart com order OD31211014951 has been initiated  Please note that items were already dispatched by the Seller and we have initiated cancel request with the courier partner  In case delivery is attempted  feel free to reject the shipment  Please check your email for more details ?I was surprised by the message and there wordings that ?your cancellation request ?I immediately called the helpline and these people told me that as per your request we have cancelled the order I shouted at them that I have not cancelled the order and show me a proof that I have cancelled the order Then he told me that I will get my money refund So this way these people use crores of rupees for 7 to 15 days But it was not the question of money refund He also told me that they have enough stocks and I can order it again According to me this is cheating because you show good price and fool the customer to generate traffic on your website So that you can claim we have so many users and every minute we are getting X number of orders This is just like one e mail I received from shophunk that get I phone 5c in 899 rs Next day on 13/12/2013 I saw the flipcart website and the price for Samsung  galaxy s duos was 9250 rs So it was proved  that it?s a fraud site and they are making fool of us Because they know very well that they can very easily make customers through fake offers I was earliar cheated by a similar website called timtara com I was cheated for 13000 rs In that also I got some very good price of mobiles and then the site was shut down after 4 or 5 months and not only me but many people like me were cheated So please be carefull because flipkart is also on its way to timtara com ?#+@2013 12 13T09:35:44+0000plz never shop from flipcart coz last time i orderd  A CONVERSE SHOES BUT i get different product        i pay 400 rs more then actual product        kindally req  u plz never shop from flipcart?#+@2013 06 28T09:59:13+0000Dear Sir

Flipkart says   SORRY FOR THE DELAY BUT WE ARE RUNNING HUGE VOLUMES OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS     well you would wouldn t u     
Next you said the money has been transferred  I have checked my bank account since past 3 days   there is no refund     An average NEFT transfer takes 5 minutes     WHY IS YOURS TAKING OVER A WEEK ???????????

That s one party I would stay away from ?#+@2013 11 23T01:19:42+0000Well if I see the word  pre order  and  Amazon  together  I remember the Sir Alex Ferguson autobiography that I had  pre ordered  from you guys  I waited eagerly for around 2 weeks after the book was launched for you guys to send it  By this time the guys who had ordered after me had got their books  Me ? All I got was an email saying my purchase is cancelled and that the refund is in progress  Oh and there was some mention about a free copy of the book  I guess you would be sending that in a couple of year s time when Sir Alex Ferguson releases a new book and there is no demand for this one  Any which ways   I think online shopping  pre order  books  movies will stick to Flipkart for now   At least their customer service doesn t have parrots sitting and replying one standard line  ?#+@2013 11 23T01:26:57+0000If u all want Gutthi back in the show then Join Kapil sharma authorised Production house K9 Fanpage http://Fb com/BabajikaThulluK9?#+@2013 11 23T13:06:20+0000Hi Amazon in 
I returned my product on 14th Nov  Still no refund  When it track it jus says  product picked up successfully  When i call customercare  you are saying wait for 10days everytime  Its been 10days  Package status hasn t moved a inch  When will you initiate my refund? This is such a pathetic system  Flipkart initiated refund the day they picked up product  You are saying it should reach your fullfillment centre and then only u will refund  There is no way to track package as ATS has no contact number  When i request your customer service to atleast send mail to Courieri guys  they are saying  We will escalate it after 10 days   So even after 10days  no guarentee of refund? What the heck? Are you fooling people? Refund my money immediately

I have called and called n called and no one cares enough to sort out the issue 
I call first time  the agent just speaks as if she is least interested  I asked for a manager  she says she cannot transfer it to a manager but can only connect me to her supervisor  Now  how on earth do you expect me to know whom she reports too  Do you really want me to know each and everything about the internal aspects of the company?
Now  she places me on hold post that saying  she will get back in 2 mins  but looks like 2 mins according to you guys in never ending  I was on hold for more than 10 mins  waiting and waiting and waiting  No one came back  So  I forcefully disconnected the call 
So  I call back again and this time I got the name  I spoke to some one by the name of Surojith  I asked him if has history of the call  he says no  How is that even possible? Do you want us to explain myself each n every time  I call? Wont you make little notes about the previous calls and maintain some history?
Fine  so  I told him that I want to speak to a supervisor  and he said  he will have to put me on hold  I refused to be on hold  coz  you guys never come back  I told him  I will be online  and wait for the supervisor  But Surojith very arrogantly and impolitely said  NO  Your company just doesnt know how to treat the customers  You are very rude and disrespectful  There is a way to speak and put forth your speech  which clearly you guys lack in 
I told him repeatedly  that I will not be on hold and that I want the supervisor and he refuse to get one for me  This shows your casual attitude towards your customer 
I am very upset and totally disappointed about this whole thing

My question here is  after returning the wrong product what guarantee do I have that either my money be refunded or product be exchanged? How I can trust them when I see the above comments stating no action taken yet    

Is it wise to return the product or is it wise for me to 1st get the right product and then return them???

Today I am compelled to share My experience with all the Customers of Snapdeal  as I am cheated by Snapdeal 
 I had tried purchasing Micromax GC333 in August 13& an amount of Rs 2599/  was deducted from my Account  
Lateron it was confirmed by SnapDeal that Your Order 1192411993 is Confirmed but I decided to Cancell My Order & Communicated 
to Snapdeal on mail to dasarpit@ymail com (Snapdeal) & on the Customer Care Phone no +91 92126 92126 & got Confirmation
 from Snapdeal in following words:  (In case the amount has been debited from your account  don t worry   we will refund it  
If you have any queries or suggestions  please Contact Us  or call us at +91 92126 92126  We look forward to hearing from you  

Warm Regards
 Snapdeal Team)

After this long time of more than 100 days neither My Money (Rs 2599/ ) is returned to me nor I received the Micromax GC333 phone from Snapdeal 
 I raised my concern for return of my amount of Rs 2599/   which is taken by Snapdeal to the Customer Care No (+91 92126 92126) & 
the provided e mail ID (dasarpit@ymail com)  but got harrasing response every time  I raised several request to Snapdeal regarding this with reference 
Request Nos (#3713736  #3339409  #3339810  #3183087  #2915277 etc )  but no resolution from Snapdeal Team & Snapdeal Team still kept My hard earned 
amount of Rs 2599/  & it seems the intention of Snapdeal is clearly reflecting to supress my amount of Rs 2599/  

I request Snapdeal team to pls  pls  pls  resturn my amount of Rs 2599/  which is taken by you for Micromax GC333 & I had not received either Micromax GC333 ]
 or Rs 2599/ 

I urge all consumers to pls  go through the incident which happened to me when I tried business with Snapdeal ?#+@2013 12 06T07:07:39+0000I also advice the same?#+@2013 12 06T04:12:37+0000"

some people might be wondering how? To answer this  let me share you my experience with snapdeal 

I am having quiet frustrating experience with Sanpdeal  I ordered Nokia lumia 920 on 31st Oct 2013  They said   they will be delivering the product by 5th Nov 2013  but I have not received my product by 5th Nov  So from 6th Nov 2013 onward  I started inquiry   they kept on saying that I will be receiving the product by next day  This thing went on till 12th Nov 2013  
On 13th Nov   I called Blue dart guys to inquiry about the shipment  After lot of argument  they accepted that they have misplaced the Item  Then informed this to Snapdeal and they said they will refund the amount  On 14th Nov I got the mail 
saying   INITIATING the REFUND process and with in 5 7 working   I will get my money back   
But till date I have got any refund  when I inquiry   they keep on saying same thing   INITIATING the REFUND process and within 5 7 working I get the money back    I am really disappointed with snapdeal  their customer care are very unsupportive  They do not understand the pain of customer 
They are holding my 25 thousand rupee till date and I have spent more then hundred rupee on just calling them all the time  I have suffered a lot and I would request all the internet user  please don t fall on trap of snapdeal  their customer care really suckes  Remmber guys  Sanpdeal is Baddeal

Today I am compelled to share My experience with all the Customers of Snapdeal  as I am cheated by Snapdeal 
 I had tried purchasing Micromax GC333 in August 13& an amount of Rs 2599/  was deducted from my Account  
Lateron it was confirmed by SnapDeal that Your Order 1192411993 is Confirmed but I decided to Cancell My Order & Communicated 
to Snapdeal on mail to dasarpit@ymail com (Snapdeal) & on the Customer Care Phone no +91 92126 92126 & got Confirmation
 from Snapdeal in following words:  (In case the amount has been debited from your account  don t worry   we will refund it  
If you have any queries or suggestions  please Contact Us  or call us at +91 92126 92126  We look forward to hearing from you  

Warm Regards

After this long time of more than 100 days neither My Money (Rs 2599/ ) is returned to me nor I received the Micromax GC333 phone from Snapdeal 
 I raised my concern for return of my amount of Rs 2599/   which is taken by Snapdeal to the Customer Care No (+91 92126 92126) & 
the provided e mail ID (dasarpit@ymail com)  but got harrasing response every time  I raised several request to Snapdeal regarding this with reference 
Request Nos (#3713736  #3339409  #3339810  #3183087  #2915277 etc )  but no resolution from Snapdeal Team & Snapdeal Team still kept My hard earned 
amount of Rs 2599/  & it seems the intention of Snapdeal is clearly reflecting to supress my amount of Rs 2599/  

I request Snapdeal team to pls  pls  pls  resturn my amount of Rs 2599/  which is taken by you for Micromax GC333 & I had not received either Micromax GC333 ]

I made 2 orders with a total of around 15 products and a total cart value of over Rs  18 000/  as below   

  1337253709 Dated 17 October 2013
  1332428493 Dated 15 October 2013

Out of these 2 orders  I received 2 broken products and 1 very cheap alternate product and have made complaints regarding the same as below   

request # 3568797
request # 3585559
request # 3616895

Earlier I was asked to click multiple pics of these broken products and send them to you  I DID THAT  Now  I am being asked to pack those products as I d received them  fill up some online form and print them and paste it on the return packet and then hand it over to the courier guy 

I must say now  I am really pissed off with your customer harassing processes and have definately decided NOT TO BUY ANYTHING AGAIN FROM SNAPDEAL 

Since I have already committed a crime by ordering products from SnapDeal  I am ready for one last effort from my side  which is  I wish to come down to your Okhla office with all your return products and submit them on my own as I think it will be easier for me than to pack them all one by one and fill and print forms and send it back 

Please let me know whom to contact in your Okhla office and if your award winning processes allow me to do so

I bought an iphone 4s from Snapdeal com for Rs34000  After using it for just a day i found it was defective  So i took it to Apple service center  There they told that the phone is a replacement phone and has no warranty  I even called up the apple customer care  they told me the same thing and suggested me to ask for a refund  So i lodged a complain on Snapdeal customer care on 30th September 2013  I didn t received any proper response from then other than a mail asking for a picture of the phone  This response was given 4days after the complain was lodged  and countless times calling the customer care  On 14th oct they arranged a reverse courier and they took the phone i got from them on 16th Oct  Now i don t have the iphone or the money  And they are not responding  Every time i call customer care they say they will get back to me in 24 to 48 hours  Since then i haven?t received any response from them  in spite of calling them regularly  
I think they don t intend to replace the phone or give me my money back  Dont buy anything from Snapdeal com  They are the biggest fraud in e marketing industry  They elude you with a comparatively cheaper price but gives you faulty damaged used product with no warranty

I have waited 1 week and still they want me wait some more 24 to 48hrs 
Every time I need to explain the entire issue
Time waste
Money waste
Mobile bills waste

They are simply saying  We are very sorry for inconvenience caused we will get back to you with in 24 to 48hrs  but they didn t get me and I don t think they will call me back  

However I am going to proceed legally with all the evidences  

But you guys please take care while placing an order in snapdeal

They will deliver faulty products
They will offer worse customer assistance
They won t resolve your problem for weeks

NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT from This Site     SNAPDEAL you should not trust     Once Paid Money means you are gone    

I have Order a product  According to SNAPDEAL Guys  It has been Dispatched to Courior Company & after that no responsibility of SNAPDEAL  

Track with Courrier Company which can never be contacted over the Phone  Online Site will say it is  In transit   But in Which City it is ? 

you can never Find  

I have Still not recieved my Product yet  I would not suggest anyone to Buy any product from this Site  VERY POOR SERVICE       

As Company they are not ready to take any Responsibility to trace my product  Once Product will be Faulty I doubt if they will really care for there Customer        Service is really Bad  

I am a Genuine Customer  You can See my Order Status  Order Number: 1534800656 

I am just Waiting the product & Waisting my Days  Worse Service  you might get Better Deal but pathatic Service in Bangalore At least      

I ll never Recomend to BUY ANY PRODUCT from SnapDeal    ?#+@2013 12 30T18:27:55+0000"

NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT from This Site     SNAPDEAL you should not trust     Once Paid Money means you are gone

Track with Courrier Company which can never be contacted over the Phone  Online Site will say it is  In transit   But in Which City it is ? 

you can never Find  

I have Still not recieved my Product yet  I would not suggest anyone to Buy any product from this Site  VERY POOR SERVICE       

As Company they are not ready to take any Responsibility to trace my product  Once Product will be Faulty I doubt if they will really care for there Customer        Service is really Bad  

I am a Genuine Customer  You can See my Order Status  Order Number: 1534800656

It was my first purchase from Snapdeal  and you want to guess the procedure on how to return the product?

NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT from This Site     SNAPDEAL you should not trust     Once Paid Money means you are gone    

I have Order a product  According to SNAPDEAL Guys  It has been Dispatched to Courior Company & after that no responsibility of SNAPDEAL  

Track with Courrier Company which can never be contacted over the Phone  Online Site will say it is  In transit   But in Which City it is ?

I have Still not recieved my Product yet  I would not suggest anyone to Buy any product from this Site  VERY POOR SERVICE       

As Company they are not ready to take any Responsibility to trace my product  Once Product will be Faulty I doubt if they will really care for there Customer        Service is really Bad  

I am a Genuine Customer  You can See my Order Status  Order Number: 1534800656 

I am just Waiting the product & Waisting my Days  Worse Service  you might get Better Deal but pathatic Service in Bangalore At least

"7577","Filing a legal complaint against Snapdeal for fraudulent services  cheating and pecuniary losses  I received a physically damaged product (Order Number: 1200686578) and it was confirmed by Snapdeal after they asked me to send snapshots of the broken product  However it has been more than 3 weeks and nobody has come for the reverse pick up not has anybody from Snapdeal tried to contact to to redress my grievances  neither by email nor via phone  I have been calling the customer care everyday for the past three weeks  They assured me that some senior staff will call me back and that the courier company has been informed for a priority based pick up every single time I called  But yesterday when I called the courier company they informed me that Snapdeal has not intimidated them at all about the reverse pick up at all  and all these days the customer support executive at Snapdeal was LYING to me  

I have had enough of trouble calling the customer support every single day  Have lost all my patience trying to communicate with the folks at Snapdeal  Luckily for me  I come from a family of lawyers  I m filing a legal case at the Bombay High Court this week since my lawyer has confirmed that this is a case of outright cheating  violation and fraudulent means of trade  I have recorded all the calls that I made to the Customer Care number over the past one week to be submitted as proof of evidence as well as the call made to the courier company  I am filing a complaint on counts of pecuniary losses  cheating by lying and giving false assurances  fraudulent trading as well as claiming reimbursement in monetary terms for all the trouble that I had to undertake due to their irresponsibility and the amount of the product the price of the product that has not been refunded yet

Why the hell is there any authority person or e mail ID to speak to in case some body wants to report for the complaint  

As your customer service don t know any thing and your e mail id no one ever respond to it  I don t know how the hell your company is managing its escalations  

order number   1222415581  1202855605

these needs to be resolved  

So if there is any thing you can do to get things sorted out do it asap  

I would recommend no one to buy from SNAP DEAL  as its a shit site to purchase anything from  they dont have any control over the third party vendor products listed on the website

I have had enough of trouble calling the customer support every single day  Have lost all my patience trying to communicate with the folks at Snapdeal  Luckily for me  I come from a family of lawyers  I m filing a legal case at the Bombay High Court this week since my lawyer has confirmed that this is a case of outright cheating  violation and fraudulent means of trade  I have recorded all the calls that I made to the Customer Care number over the past one week to be submitted as proof of evidence as well as the call made to the courier company  I am filing a complaint on counts of pecuniary losses  cheating by lying and giving false assurances  fraudulent trading as well as claiming reimbursement in monetary terms for all the trouble that I had to undertake due to their irresponsibility and the amount of the product the price of the product that has not been refunded yet  

I also got in touch with a leading national daily asking them to cover this fraudulent means of retailing in their newspaper in Bangalore  Pune  Mumbai  Ahmedabad and Chennai  The reporter I spoke to wanted to get in touch with other people who have been cheated by Snapdeal in case I knew anyone personally  If anybody wishes to contribute to the report  drop in a message to me ?#+@2013 09 23T00:50:45+0000"

I have had enough of trouble calling the customer support every single day  Have lost all my patience trying to communicate with the folks at Snapdeal  Luckily for me  I come from a family of lawyers  I m filing a legal case at the Bombay High Court this week since my lawyer has confirmed that this is a case of outright cheating  violation and fraudulent means of trade  I have recorded all the calls that I made to the Customer Care number over the past one week to be submitted as proof of evidence as well as the call made to the courier company  I am filing a complaint on counts of pecuniary losses  cheating by lying and giving false assurances  fraudulent trading as well as claiming reimbursement in monetary terms for all the trouble that I had to undertake due to their irresponsibility and the amount of the product the price of the product that has not been refunded yet  

I also got in touch with a leading national daily asking them to cover this fraudulent means of retailing in their newspaper in Bangalore  Pune  Mumbai  Ahmedabad and Chennai  The reporter I spoke to wanted to get in touch with other people who have been cheated by Snapdeal in case I knew anyone personally  If anybody wishes to contribute to the report  drop in a message to me ?#+@2013 09 23T00:51:03+0000The biggest fake store in india is snapdeal?#+@2014 04 08T17:48:36+0000"

This is my order id
1130228671

And i am absolutely surprised when it showing me the estimated shipping
date is 31st July 2013 for my Micromax Phone  I purchased with you because
i expected that you guys will make the faster delivery as like
flipkart com  Coz i really really appreciated the
flipkart com delivery they absolutely delivered the items within 5 working
days Since order     AND HERE YOU ARE SHOWING ME THAT 31ST JULY SHIPPING
DATE   is this correct way to sustain in today s cut throat competitions
among the online portals 

Please improve it and try to deliver my UNDER said ordered items till 27th
July at least  SO I CAN THINK NEXT TIME FOR YOU INSTEAD OF FLIPKART COM  
else we have to find out another option like saholic com which promises to
deliver the shipments within 5 working days  failure on which
saholic compays the amount  ?#+@2013 07 24T05:58:46+0000Had ordered a INR 64 000 Nikon camera from Snapdeal on Apr 26  they said  promised shipping date Apr 29  then delayed it to May 2  it s May 4 now  and the customer care who couldn t care less about the customer  still has no clue of when it will be shipped let alone delivered  This is ridiculous in a day of 1 day delivery by Flipkart and Amazon       a very frustrating experience  They say they have no stock and yet they had the product online  took my money and keep shifting the promised shipment date  post which it could take 4 7 days to reach me  They don t even have a simple cancellation policy  Worst online shopping experience ever  Don t buy from Snapdeal  they don t care about you and they don t know the meaning of  promise   Now  customer care says we will discuss with our team by Monday evening  which is May 5 and confirm when the product can be shipped  Think Snapdeal should either sell out or shut their business  they are simply incorrigible  They promised to deliver after I wrote to the CEO and then 1 day later cancelled  siting that the product is out of stock ?#+@2014 05 05T14:28:26+0000"

to pick up the same as the area doesnt cover under thier courier service How did they sent the order in first place 

First of all I got atleast 6 replies in these 20 days saying they are coming to pick up the product but they never show up even once   

Highly ignorant and insensitive behavior of them When I placed order they readily deliver in time but when the product was falty they dont 

want to come and collect this is thier outstanding after sales service They think common man won t raise voice and they can cheat anyone and 

everyone  The same issue was encountered with couple of my collegues too and they resolved it with pain and took a months time  This company 

doesnt deserves loyal customers  Seriously guys do not shop from here your trust will be hammered

Please share this if you want to spread the awareness about the harassment likely to happen with 

your purchase with Snapdeal 

Please go through my first and undoubtedly the last experience with Snapdeal as narrated below:

Order details:

Order Id: 1054757615 
Order placed on: 16th June  2013  4:47 PM 
Item name: Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562 White 
Amount is already paid

This has still not been delivered to the shipping address in Kokata as I am writing this note on 

11th July  close to one month after I placed the order  

I have called up Snapdeal helpline at least ten times as per the following details: 

1  For first few days  every time I called I was told to wait for 24 hours by when the product 

will be delivered  

2  When it was not delivered  I checked with the courier  First Flight directly and came to know 

that the item is caught in Kolkata airport customs because of non payment of sales tax duty and 

the product will be released only after the court hearing which will take more than a month  

3  When I got back to Snapdeal with this information and asked for a refund  they finally 

acknowledged it and said refund will be initiated within 48 hours and I will get a confirmation 

on the same  but it will take further 7 to 10 days to get the money back  This happened on 5th 

July  

4  I have not yet got any revert  When I called them today  finally they are saying they have to 

get the product back to their warehouse before they can initiate the refund  

Not only that  I bought this phone to send to my dad as a gift and now this is a huge 

embarrassment to me  because my dad  being from the older generation doesn t believe in the 

credibility of eCommerce and now Snapdeal has fantastically justified his credence to this

This order was placed on 2nd July  on the occasion of my father s b day as his gift  This order was placed after lots of effort in fetching at Ray Ban stores and finally got it on Snapdeal  There were plenty of emotions behind placing the order  With all such effort  we took all care by ourself picking the order from Bluedart office so that we do not miss gifting it on the occasion  

But finally it all happened which we were so afraid of purchasing online  After all our effort and care  the product was of no use as it was of smaller size than we ordered  The product we ordered was <Ray Ban Rb3025001 51 58 14 135 Gold Frame Aviator Sunglasses >
and we received Product Name <Ray Ban Rb3025001 51 55 14 135 Gold Frame Aviator Sunglasses >  Do Snapdeal thinks the customer is fool and not aware of the product they are purchasing?

Now we thought that this could have been by mistake  so we always can utilize an option of reverse it back and get exchange it with the correct product  We again tried to be gentle customer and made all the effort to expedite the reversal process by not waiting of pickup from the door and ourselves going Bluedart office and making all the formalities by 6th July  We updated the AWD number to Snapdeal Customer Care by 8th July 2013 and got the response that we will be contacted by Snapdeal regarding the same  In all this process already around 1 week of customers time is wasted 

But what we receive today is even more shocking that after waiting for so long  we are getting our refund back not the original product which was ordered initially  There was no discussion in the meanwhile but straight away we receive a mail saying that we have agreed to receive the refund  And on checking with the companies customer care  we came to know that order is not available so we are provided with the refund  But on cross checking  the product with the same code is still showing available on the website (Attached is the screen shot for your proof and my evidence)  This is really strange being a customer and ordering from such a reliable name i e  Snapdeal  You are no where near the term Customer satisfaction  There could be 100 other ways to settle this issue  instead of refund  

I am sure this could lead me to take some legal actions against such an esteemed firm but really not sure how will you help and in what manner you will compensate for this 2 weeks of time  effort and moreover  our emotions  But after all this  I personally would never come back and purchase from Snapdeal and its a real deal  Not only this will spread all negative about the same to all my Online Freak Friends 

Thanks 
Warm Regards

 I ordered a product on Snapdeal on July 3  2013  The order no  is 1041769354  I was delivered a wrong product that too very late i e  on July 24  2013 (20 days after ordering)  I was then promised a reverse pickup within next 4 business days  My complaint no  is 2400619  Till date there has been no reverse pickup  Now they tell me to send the package to Snapdeal myself 
 When I call up the customer care  they repeat the same thing and keep on saying  sorry  uselessly and then hangup when I ask for escalation of this issue 
 This is very unprofessional and short sighted approach with which Snapdeal is doing business  I  very strongly  urge Snapdeal to look into this matter  I can be contacted on 9582691699 ?#+@2013 07 08T12:19:56+0000Whole Community Above 
I m also the one who s suffering of their pathetic Behaviour

This was my first experience with snapdeal  You guys sent me products of super substandard quality like that of Palika Bazar thele wala stuff in name of branded products under UCB and Provogue brandnames against order no: 1052519525 
I sent the products back to you guys as advised by you  But till now I have not recieved my refund  On top of that no one is picking calls on customer care no 9212692126 I think this is world s first customer care for which customer has to pay STD rates only to hear computerised machine IVR  I must have exhausted about 200 hundred bucks listening to that robotic aunty to get my refund god knows when would real aunty speak out :P

jokes apart kindly help me get my refund for this first experience 

Thanks & best regards

People  please do not order products from this site  They first send a used product and then refuse to take it back on one pretext or the other  My complaint has still not been resolved  for reasons best known to them  I wish I could upload pics here to show exactly how bad the product delivered to me is  

http://www snapdeal com/?#+@2013 06 27T05:54:35+0000The WORST service provider    i ordered twice to your u   n both the times the orders u were unable to place on time    order no  980707044  which is placed well before mother s day that is on 7th may   and mothers day on 12th    and ur first thing from the list delivered on 14 thats ohkk   but the other relevant products u sent me like i just wanted to cancel them all  :/ which were delivered on 16 th n all   n all    i just want them all consolidated    i placed order in consolidate list   then y u sent me things in pieces   i felt sad that i couldn t gift things to my mom on that day  n just kept on waiting  but u ppl even not cared about customers feelings  and atleast u should tell us the exact day u gonna deliver   its not possible to wait u ppl for 2 weeks 24/7   huh?#+@2013 06 27T09:10:29+0000Your service is pathetic this is fourth time I am writing mail to you guys  some stupid person referred your site to me but now I can understand my opinion about you is true  it?s being almost 5 days that my parcel is picked from my office but there is no further communication if your service is so pathetic in metros then god save the people who are ordering from other cities please let me know the answer or else I have to personally write to higher authority of your company

Billing Issues 

Order no 1015289450 
Cancelled by Snapdeal refund amount awaited i e 2286 INR

Order no  973304597
Similar problem was with following item(s) from order 973304597  corrected under request no  2060934

Ongoing issues with Snap deal orders in recent pastway leads to a conclusion about fraudulent mannerism of billing  
If Snap deal can not afford discount  suggestion is to stop portraying the same 

Over the billing value and then discounted is so sincerely not needed and is resulting in unnecessary activity giving a
conflict of interest to change online vendor   Also encouraging and responsibility enough to report this to consumer court  

Now again  more than an hour of telephonic discussion and other activity is done to inform about the Order 1043298396 details   Billing Issues  

This is utterly absurd and nonsensical way of business approach

This is my worst online buying experience ever  I ordered an HTC One X+ on May 30 (order no 1020548922)  and my phone was to be dispatched on 4th June  The tracking status changed to 6th  and now you say it s delayed by another 3 days  All the customer care exec had to say was that  you can cancel the order  
I hoped the services were better considering the brand name  and I am really disappointed 
Such a waste of time ?#+@2013 06 06T13:45:23+0000yes you r right?#+@2013 06 07T07:44:06+0000"

Had ordered 2 Pro biker Gloves (XL) from them  they sent me the gloves but one being a XXL and other being a L size
i mean how pathetic can a company be 
Now asking me to courier the the package backto them  without assuring the return of a XL sized glove 
if this is what am supposed to do then why are you giving it online  i would rather go to a retail outlet and buy the product 

Assured me a return reply by 3rd June     and yet no response

Item	Mahindra Duro   Two Wheeler (125cc)   Cappuccino Brown (On Road Price)
Query	as per terms and condition of the deal some representative has to come to my address within 2 days to complete rc book paper work and collect documents for the same   i have placed order on 2nd june 2013 and today is 17062013 but till now no one has talked to me about this  i have lodged the complaint several times during last 15 days but it goes to deaf people and on 14062013 after insisting so much that some one from higher authority should talk to me   one pradeep tripathi called me back and promised me that my prob will be resolved in 2 working days by 15052016 evening but still no one has talked to me for completing the deal    i think and i wish please look in the matter and stop harresing me and cancel the deal and send me cancellation mail to me without further delay?#+@2013 06 17T08:01:27+0000what a joke      crapdeal?#+@2013 06 27T07:20:21+0000:)?#+@2013 06 27T16:52:01+0000This has been the most pathetic experience that I have had with any online shopping portal  I booked this order on 21st June  2013 so that I can have it delivered to my sister for her birthday on 30th June  2013  The delivery date was mentioned as 26th June  2013  When the consignment was not delivered on 26th  I checked with the order status and in that process followed up with First Flight courier service  They had absolutely no clue about the shipment  Then I got in touch with the customer support of Snapdeal and logged in a complaint with complaint number: 2416095  ON 27th when I checked my order status  it was showing as shipped from Gurgaon on 27th itself  Today on 29th when I am trying to track my order it is showing the status of  In Transit   When I got in touch with First Flight again they have no clue about the shipment  They asked me to get in touch with them after an hours time  each time that I called them and that is 5 times  And to add to all of this there has been no communication from Snapdeal to clarify any of the problems that I have faced 
Now I just hope that I get my shipment  even though the intent to gift it to my sister will not happen and all of this thanks to Snapdeal  I should have listened to my friends when they had advised me against Snapdeal ?#+@2013 06 29T08:56:42+0000"

"8084","hi snapdeal  there is any offer on memory card + pen drive  i need 8 MC + 16 PD ?#+@2013 05 29T13:43:06+0000Most pathetic online site ever     
Had ordered 2 Pro biker Gloves (XL) from them  they sent me the gloves but one being a XXL and other being a L size
i mean how pathetic can a company be 
Now asking me to courier the the package backto them  without assuring the return of a XL sized glove 
if this is what am supposed to do then why are you giving it online  i would rather go to a retail outlet and buy the product 

Assured me a return reply by 3rd June     and yet no response

Pathetic service to say the least 

Order ID   1299285704  placed on 30th April and expected date of delivery was on 3rd May  It was not delivered and then this order was automatically cancelled later on by snapdeal and the order was replaced 
The new order ID   1314398884 was placed by snapdeal without consulting me with expected delivery date of 12th May  Then got an SMS on 8th May that the order had been dispatched but no tracking details have not been given on the site  From past 5 days i e  120 hrs this is the msg being displayed on my snapdeal account    Product has been handed over to courier  Please check for tracking details after 12 hours  

120 hrs and no action and that too after promise of 12 hours  I highly doubt that even the order has been dispatched 

After such unprofessional service from your site  all i want is refund of the payment and I promise never to return to your site again ?#+@2013 05 13T12:33:33+0000bekaar  ?#+@2013 05 13T13:35:33+0000Hi Shivshekhar  can you please check and confirm if the number shared by you 1299285704 is order number or is it AWB number or any other reference code  This doesn t seem to be a valid order number  Alternatively please share your email id at reachout@snapdeal com and we will check the issue on order purchased through that email id?#+@2013 05 13T13:54:24+0000The Order number is 968717280

Dear Snap Deal I request you to stop fooling me It has been clearly understood that the order was returned to you on 6 th may 2013 and that was why the ticket no 2071506 was initiated  you also aware of it  And I received the below mail after hanging around for five days and which is also is generic in nature  What is the meaning of following sentence in the mail   We are forwarding your request for the refund and once the refund will be processed   I want to know what were your actions since 6 may 2013 for initiating refund  You people turned out to be vultures who live on corpses  First collect money from the customer and harass him for delivery then force him to cancel orders after frustration and then hold his money for months in the name of refund process and live upon the interest gained by that  Is this your business philosophy? Be specific on refund initiation and send me a mail with proper reference numbers before 13 May 2013  
Have some credibility and be swift in resolving my issue

Friends Please Don?t Deal with SNAPDEAL anymore?They are Bunch of cheaters  
Here is the complete story?

Well  The Hell Began when I ordered a HP Laptop (Order ID 947664353)  Which Eventually turns out to be a faulty product and nightmare started 
I raise three web complaint had  no clue about the issue except a one line  The Concern Team Will call YOu BAck 
I called almost 30 times to their customer service no  92126 92126  But all in vain  They are toooooo rude to bear 
I even wrote to its CEO Mr  Kunal Bahl (kunal bahl@snapdeal com)  But that too did not get me anywhere

Product is superb but it comes with MISSING Power Connecter & External MIC which should be available inside the box by default  As confirmed with local sellers they said it comes inside the box  How can snapdeal com sell this way  accepting it that we have not listed it and so its not there inside the box  But these things are core components of the Player that comes by default

"8406","Hi All 

I have placed an Order for the Micromax Canvas HD A 116 19th Feb 2012  I was committed a shipment timeline of 19th March 2012  Today I get a mail from you all saying that the Order will delayed by 10 more working days 

This is an extremely unprofessional attitude towards to your Customers  I am waiting patiently for over 1 month for the phone and on the last date when you are supposed to send the shipment you have intimated me that there will be a further 10 working days delay  This is an extremely irritating and infuriating development and shows no consideration towards the Customer  And most importantly they are using our money to buy phones from china and using the money interest free where can a company get interest free money for more then 40 calendar days  Frankly  I am disgusted 

If you are thinking that people are going to tolerate your incompetence just because your product is cheaper than others in the markets then you are sadly mistaken  as there is nothing more desirable than reliability  which you are demonstrating a desperate lack of  Your offer of a carry case etc  are pure hogwash and I am not interested in the same  If you are really looking to service your Customers properly  there has to be a transparent communication well in advance  You cannot expect us to believe that you figured out that there would be a delay only on the last date of the shipment  Your excuse of offering the product at a lesser price also does not cut any ice with me as I have placed the offer well before the budget post which the price was revised  

There has to be a composition to a customer who has given payment well in advance and a harassment to a customer that has gone through the whole process  Even senior level employees are arrogant to answer customers problem as if we pay money to them so that they can harass us 

So beware before you buy anything from Snap Deal there is not guarantee or timeline of products or services  They think we are fools

Two week before i ordered Seagate Backup Plus 1TB Hard Drive (Red) with freebies of  carry case(Pouch)  from snapdeal com  after 5 days i got a delivery but it is only for Hard drive  they did not delivered carry case(pouch) 
after that i registered my complaint on snapdeal help desk (My complaint number is 1734802)  today i got a call from snapdeal and they are saying  our Seagate hard drive vendor don t have inventory of carry case(pouch) so we are offering you 100 rupees snapdeal voucher 
here i want to ask few question to Snapdeal
1  is carry case(pouch) available on your site for rupees 100?
2  if your vendor don t have inventory of carry case(pouch) then why should you are still displaying carry case(pouch) as a freebies on your site??#+@2013 03 13T09:38:53+0000"

The refund amount of 1075 Rupees has not been put in my cashback even after repeated complaints  The customer care people just fool you by saying it has been given high priority or by saying we will assure you it will be resolved by the end of the day   I regret the inconvenience caused  That s all i get to hear  The inconvenience has crossed the limits and I have spent around 50 bucks calling you guys in vain 
I got to know from the supervisor that the team is not working for 2 3 days now But  the customer care guys keep fooling you I am having second thoughts about myntra com recently  They are not doing a great job  Good luck on losing the customers ?#+@2013 12 25T06:21:39+0000I think Myntra is doing desperately to harass to the customers by sending different sizes and to highlight that we have huge customers and annual turnover  The site is totally considered to be fake and cheating to the customers  By thinking that to get suitable size but it is so strange that it is of a entirely different size  They are trying to extract money from the customers  Firstly they will not update your delivery system   so that one can not cancel the product immediately  which saves money to them for these days  Secondly when the update will done then pick up will be so late  Thirdly inspection and refund will taking so many days  In the end our money will stuck with them for month of days and finally the offer will go end and you have to buy the item by paying more money  because automatically the price of the product will increase  But the credit myntra will get that we gave like 90% off during Christmas and they will get huge publicity  But finally most of the products during this offer must have size different and etc  by doing this they will keep the money for more than one month and in the end again we will buy the product in higher price  because during that time the offer may not be there  So my sincere advise to the customers know the logic of myntra and never place an order  Better to go other online portal site  It is my first purchase from myntra and I have been harassed ?#+@2013 12 27T08:12:10+0000Yesterday(26/12/13) in the afternoon the product is delivered to me but so far the delivered status is not updated  Since the size(36 ) is very very large  I wanted to exchange the item as per my order size(32 ) and this is communicated to  myntra customer care  But the customer care said as long as the status is not updated the item can t be placed for exchange  How far I have to wait for status  to be updated god knows  They are making to the customers foolish  What I will do write now???#+@2013 12 27T08:11:20+0000The order id: 9417049(Excalibur Men Grey Checked Slim Fit Formal Trousers)   is delivered today(i e  26/12/2013) But it is so surprised that  the delivered product s size(36 ) is much more larger than the size(32 ) I had placed  So want to replace this to my order size(32 )  Please guide me  This is the first time I had given an order  but it is so strange that the delivery items size is entirely different ?#+@2013 12 26T13:15:18+0000nice  ?#+@2013 12 26T05:34:42+0000"

I ordered one Levi s jacket from myntra com on the 19th of December 2013 and Then I got a text saying I will receive it on the Saturday so I called up the delivery guy(NARESH)( number   8130 896983)
and I told him that I won t be available in the office on Saturday and Sunday so I told him deliver it to me on Monday  

So I again I got a text from myntra saying you will receive your order on Sunday so I again called him up( naresh) on the told him the same thing not to come and come on Monday so he was like ok

So then today morning I called him up(naresh) just to confirm that is he coming today to deliver the order so he is like I m on leave and and he gave me some other delivery guys(mohammed) (number  +91 8130 896982) number and told me to call and ask him when is he gonna come and deliver your order

And I called him up(Mohammed) and asked him and he told that he has no information about my order then I explained him about my order he told me he will deliver it by today   then I called up naresh and told him that Mohammed doesn t know anything about my ordered so naresh gave me other number and told me to talk to the manager and tell him about your order   so I called up the manager I don t know his name(8130 896977) I called him and told him about my order he is like your order has been canceled 

How on earth they can cancel my order without even asking me 

He told me that naresh canceled my order and I called naresh and ask him why he canceled my order he has no clue about it

So tell me what I m I suppose to do

"10870","Dollars ?#+@2013 12 27T13:12:22+0000I think Myntra is doing desperately to harass to the customers by sending different sizes and to highlight that we have huge customers and annual turnover  The site is totally considered to be fake and cheating to the customers  By thinking that to get suitable size but it is so strange that it is of a entirely different size  They are trying to extract money from the customers  Firstly they will not update your delivery system   so that one can not cancel the product immediately  which saves money to them for these days  Secondly  when the update will done then pick up will be so late  Thirdly inspection and refund will taking so many days  In the end our money will stuck with them for month of days and finally the offer will go end and you have to buy the item by paying more money  because automatically the price of the product will increase  But the credit myntra will get that we gave like 90% off during Christmas and they will get huge publicity  But finally most of the products during this offer must have size different and etc  by doing this they will keep the money for more than one month and in the end again we will buy the product in higher price  because during that time the offer may not be there  So my sincere advise to the customers know the logic of myntra and never place an order  Better to go other online portal site  It is my first purchase from myntra and I have been harassed ?#+@2013 12 27T07:15:58+0000not satisfied with their service my product returned back to their warehouse without any reason and when I called the cc guys they did not have a valid and satisfying reason for this now I ll have to sweat and wait to get my money back minus interest I appeal all not to purchase from here ?#+@2013 12 24T09:05:22+0000never satisfied?#+@2013 12 23T22:23:42+0000worst service       ?#+@2013 12 23T22:23:09+0000Worst service?#+@2013 12 23T19:23:55+0000Tch hrt?#+@2013 12 23T06:41:44+0000I have placed an order (Order No  9170875) on 12th Dec but even it s delivered on 16 but one product is delivered wrong size but when i had call myntra customer care they had said that this order is in shipped status and i can not exchange the product on 20 that order is marked delivered but the size i need in exchange now that is out of stock so who is responsible for it if you people cant serve the customer then why the hell you people made such fake commitment in TV add and on your website whereas on the same day i had ordered on jabong com there also was the same issue of exchange was there but on my first and last phone call the had exchange that order that is the level of concern and care those people had shown and given to me as a customer that i can easily say jabong com is the best site to do shopping and myntra com is the worst and most inappropriate site for shopping nor i am going to do any purchase in future neither i am going to recommend anyone to do so     worst experience of shopping in my whole life   ?#+@2013 12 24T13:02:35+0000@myntra kindly check your email for complaint regarding ORDER NO  9034936 i have already emailed you pics of product delivered to me kindly provide me resolution at the earliest ?#+@2013 12 23T06:40:29+0000"

I ordered one Levi s jacket from myntra com on the 19th of December 2013 and Then I got a text saying I will receive it on the Saturday so I called up the delivery guy(NARESH)( number   8130 896983)
and I told him that I won t be available in the office on Saturday and Sunday so I told him deliver it to me on Monday  

So I again I got a text from myntra saying you will receive your order on Sunday so I again called him up( naresh) on the told him the same thing not to come and come on Monday so he was like ok

So then today morning I called him up(naresh) just to confirm that is he coming today to deliver the order so he is like I m on leave and and he gave me some other delivery guys(mohammed) (number  +91 8130 896982) number and told me to call and ask him when is he gonna come and deliver your order

And I called him up(Mohammed) and asked him and he told that he has no information about my order then I explained him about my order he told me he will deliver it by today   then I called up naresh and told him that Mohammed doesn t know anything about my ordered so naresh gave me other number and told me to talk to the manager and tell him about your order   so I called up the manager I don t know his name(8130 896977) I called him and told him about my order he is like your order has been canceled 

How on earth they can cancel my order without even asking me 

He told me that naresh canceled my order and I called naresh and ask him why he canceled my order he has no clue about it

So tell me what I m I suppose to do

This is RIDICULOUS    very sad

i really want an answer for it?#+@2013 12 24T07:04:35+0000Order # 9206175
Shipped on 16th  ECom Express s site is down so no tracking available  Still not delivered which is weird for NCR to NCR delivery  as 3 days have passed  Request you to provide tracking information atleast

Placed an order worth 3850 Rs  from Myntra com(Order ID: 8575258) on 7th November  9 days(SLA 5 7 days) after the order was placed  the courier guy calls and asks to collect the courier from their office(7 kms away)  On telling him that he is supposed to deliver  he talks rudely and doesn t turn up for the next 2 days  Registered a complaint(#384345) for the same 
Today  they call up and say you would not get the free product that was part of our order (worth 2955/ ) and would only get the remaining things at the same price  We said we want what was promised to us and is part of our invoice  Without our confirmation they cancel our order  So  I : 
1) am feeeling cheated  promised something delivered nothing
2) Had to go through the ordeal of talking and following up with the myntra customer care executives 
3) Had to Bear with their rude behaviour for no fault of yours

I have purchased Lee Cooper brown color shoes in Jan 2013 and have never Polished due to less in use  But certainly last month When I have polished shoes with brown color polish then it come to know that color of both shoes is mismatched due to different leather used  After that When I have used black color polished on one shows then only color match  Now When I raised this issue to myntra they clearly refused to change my shoes

I have purchased Lee Cooper brown color shoes in Jan 2013 and have never Polished due to less in use  But certainly last month When I have polished shoes with brown color polish then it come to know that color of both shoes is mismatched due to different leather used  After that When I have used black color polished on one shows then only color match  Now When I raised this issue to myntra they clearly refused to change my shoes 
So advising you all not to buy anything from this bullshit site There is no option for attachment of a picture else I can attach that also Now I will go to consumer court regarding this fraud

Flipkart was started by Sachin and Binny Bansal  Myntra was started by Mukesh Bansal None of them are brothers and both the companies came out of Bangalore  Similarities end  Myntra is exclusively into fashion and lifestyle products  Flipkart is nearly four times more funded than Myntra and out to look for more  Average order size here is Rs  1250 which is still lower than that of Flipkart ? $35 for Flipkart against 24 for Myntra?#+@2013 06 19T01:53:03+0000Snooopppp Dogggggg?#+@2013 06 17T12:29:37+0000<3?#+@2013 06 20T02:11:38+0000nice pic?#+@2013 06 22T02:16:50+0000"

  Fit some turning radius limiter (Turning radius should decrease by 85% atleast)  so we dont get to see drivers who from dead stop next to footpath enter a main road in a jiffy and then put their head out to see if someone is coming behind

when the crime rate across the
country has increased manifold 
a surprising incident took place
which regained one?s faith in
humanity 
Fortyfour year old Chandrappa
G  who has been driving an
auto since a decade in the city 
reached the Commissioner of
Police office on Infantry Road in
Bangalore to return a bag
containing Rs  50 000 which an
old couple had left behind in his
auto  The auto driver said the
bag was left behind by the
couple who had got down at
Malleswaram  With the help of
police  the couple was traced 
On Sunday morning  at around
5:30 am  Chandrappa was
approached by an aged couple at
the Railway Station who wanted
to hire an auto till
Malleshwaram 
After dropping the elderly
passengers  Chandrappa was
headed towards his residence in
Nandini Layout to drop his wife
to the bus stand 
Once he parked his auto he
found a bag full of some clothes 
medicines and Rs  50 300 cash 
He returned to Malleshwaram to
return the bag but was
unsuccessful in locating the
house 
The bag was taken to the
Commissioner of Police where it
was checked and a slip with few
phone numbers was found in it 
Although most of the numbers
did not work  one number ws
that of a person named Raghu
who gave the contact details of
the owner of the bag  Srinivas
Iyengar 
After receiving a call from the
police station regarding the lost
bag  Srinivas Iyengar reached
the commissioner?s office
accompanied by his son 
Overwhelmed by the honesty of
the auto driver  Srinivas
rewarded him with Rs  5000 and
said that he must be honored
for his act

1 Please design an Android APP for calculating the correct Auto fare from and to  critical points in bangalore  example: from shanthinagar bus stand to NR colony bus stop
The app should also show the route  to the user to reach destination so that there will be ample proof if there is over charge displayed in the auto meter 
Google maps may be used 
2  Many people may not be using the apps in the mobile and many people are not literate enough to use the latest technology  For them advertisement boards displaying the auto fares from bus stand and Railway stations to the area landmarks will be helpful  Even if a book is printed and make auto drivers compulsorily keep it in auto so that commuters can refer them

Most of these vehicles are NOT maintained properly to save costs  without functional brake lights  overloaded  steel wires pointing outside the trucks etc  all of them jeopardizing the safety of the others on the road  It would be really nice if BTP could investigate the broken down vehicles  fine them or punish them so that wecould bring the no of such occurrences down in the future ?#+@2013 12 16T07:06:59+0000Thank you for the prompt information ?#+@2013 12 16T08:00:40+0000"

The 8th Cross road (East) in HAL II Stage connects 12th Main to 14th Main and crosses 12A  12B  13  12A & 13B mains  The vehicular traffic on this narrow residential road has crossed all limits  so much so that it is impossible for the residents to step out or walk a few steps without being endangered by the rash and reckless vehicles in both directions 
For the safety of pedestrians  it is imperative to calm the traffic on this road by 
1  Imposing speed limit of 30km/hr 
2  Providing speed breaker road humps conforming to IRC Norms
3  Providing 1 5 M wide passages on either side of the road for pedestrians to walk  marked suitably with white lines

I am happy to see hope  because it shows the existence of faith  Without faith  one cannot hope because  to my mind  hope is an attitude evolving out of the inner faith in the heart  And the way hope is exhibited is in one s ability to wait  It is nothing but faith which gives patience  and I am therefore always happy to see hope featuring in abhyasis  letters  May your faith grow and grow

I am happy to see hope  because it shows the existence of faith  Without faith  one cannot hope because  to my mind  hope is an attitude evolving out of the inner faith in the heart  And the way hope is exhibited is in one s ability to wait  It is nothing but faith which gives patience  and I am therefore always happy to see hope featuring in abhyasis  letters  May your faith grow and grow

This is the common problem almost at all signals       Honking is required for some real idiots      not on wide roads where you have space     BMTC should take some measures in educating BMTC and Truck drivers to have smooth flow at signals ?#+@2013 09 30T17:51:00+0000"

     All autowala s should display police station complaint numbers also   Also make it compulsory for all autos to produce a bill   may be a printed copy which generates from the KM reading machine or manually he can enter traveled from and to  total distance traveled and applicable charges  That bill should contain information such as his vehicle no  complaint no in case of misbehavior or over charging  Many have lost their valuables in autos because they won t be knowing in which Auto they will be travelling  Its very difficult to note down the auto numbers all the time  Instead make it mandatory for all auto drivers to produce a bill  This could be great idea to implement  If autowala do not agree to produce a bill you are not at all eligible to pay him anything  You can walk free without paying him  Its a easy step which you can take  It just need a small initiative from you  Nothing else  It is not costing you anything

     All autowala s should display police station complaint numbers also   Also make it compulsory for all autos to produce a bill   may be a printed copy which generates from the KM reading machine or manually he can enter traveled from and to  total distance traveled and applicable charges  That bill should contain information such as his vehicle no  complaint no in case of misbehavior or over charging  Many have lost their valuables in autos because they won t be knowing in which Auto they will be travelling  Its very difficult to note down the auto numbers all the time  Instead make it mandatory for all auto drivers to produce a bill  This could be great idea to implement  If autowala do not agree to produce a bill you are not at all eligible to pay him anything  You can walk free without paying him  Its a easy step which you can take  It just need a small initiative from you  Nothing else  It is not costing you anything 

Do something good for which people of Bangalore could be proud off you  Please look in to this and hope you will implement it in a better way than what I/we thought about it ?#+@2013 09 21T04:55:04+0000"

1 	White stripes on road humps help drivers to see the humps from a distance and slow down  But now a days the stripes are absent on many humps  Either they are not painted or they fade away after some time  Traffic Police may please pay attention to this 
2 	At many Electronic traffic signals the amber lights are not functioning  The amber lights provide some cushioning time between signals and thereby help in avoiding accidents  The Traffic Police may please consider this 
3 	The fines imposed for some traffic violations are a pittance  A fine of Rs 100 for example is not sufficient to act as a deterrent   The offenders will just pay the fine and forget it  I am not saying that huge fines should be imposed for small offences  but they should at least be sufficient to deter people from thinking that they can get away by paying a small amount as fine ?#+@2013 08 09T09:09:11+0000Bangalore Traffic Police : Please ensure proper roads first  Always interested in collecting fine amount and stopping the vehicles un necessarily for merely checking fine dues  Also Why there is no control over Auto  who doesnt care about laws  rules and absolutely no discipline ?#+@2013 08 09T14:50:27+0000u r r8 mr  Ramadhas Ar        they people always  looking  forward fine        sorry  not   fine called  as  LANCHA?#+@2013 08 09T17:37:02+0000"

"19235","Caught drunk driving  men to serve hospitals    
New Delhi  July  2013  PTI:
Two men sentenced to five and 10 days imprisonment for drunken driving have been given a chance by a Delhi court to reform themselves by doing community service at government hospitals including doing menial jobs there 

Additional sessions judge Savita Rao directed Central Delhi residents Harbhajan Singh and Vinod Prasad  convicted in separate cases of drunken driving  to serve at St Stephen?s Hospital and Hegdewar Hospital respectively for ten days 

The court directed them to do community service ?including the menial jobs as assigned by the medical superintendent of the hospitals to grant them an opportunity to reform themselves ?

The ASJ also directed the medical superintendents of the two hospitals to send a compliance report of its order 

The order of the court came on appeal moved by Singh and Prasad against the magisterial court order  While Singh was sentenced to ten day imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2 100 by the magistrate on his pleading guilty to drunken driving  Prasad was handed down five day simple imprisonment and slapped with a fine of Rs 2 000  

After depositing the fine amount  Singh in his appeal before the Sessions court said being a widower  he has to look after his three children and assured the court that he would not repeat the offence in future 

Prasad also pleaded for leniency  saying he is the sole bread earner in his family comprising five children and his family will have to face social stigma if he is sent to jail

Well I agree with you to some extent that we do not have specific learning centers and even we do not have learning centers anywhere in India or abroad   I think we should open such centers(inspired by movie  English Vinglsih )  But there is hell lot of books and tools available on internet now a days and most importantly our local FRIENDS   These are more than enough to learn a language   

But FYI    

1  Hindi is not a national language  Its proved and there is verdict by high court of Gujarat  Go and Google or digest this link   

http://articles timesofindia indiatimes com/2010 01 25/india/28148512_1_national language official language hindi

2  My mother tongue is Kannada  And I am proud of it  Its the oldest language with script on earth  

3  There is nothing like national mother tongue  I respect all languages of India  In fact I m proud that India is such a diversified country 

4  Well coming to this post  the number of outsiders are increasing day by day in Bengaluru  Bengaluru itself is responsible for this because of its people  weather and opportunities  that once the outsider come and visit the city  he/she just fell in love with this city and decides to stay here permanently  Thats the beauty of this city  We are not opposing that at all  Its the outsider s moral responsibility to adjust to the new environment  Respect the local culture  language  food  etc  If an outsider plan to stay long then he should learn the regional language for his/her betterment and own benefits  One should learn a new language to explore the new things  After all its a KNOWLEDGE  Thats what the attitude of an outsider should be?  right?? 

AGREE???

RESPECT ALL LANGUAGES  LOVE YOUR MOTHER TONGUE       After all learning a new language means gaining access to a whole new WORLD     ?#+@2013 05 09T12:30:41+0000that is this nation first??

Yashwantpur Circle  Just in front of Yashwantpur Police station is tuning into a dangerous mess endangering the lives of people who like to stay on the right side of the law  
Buses and 2 wheelers zipping on the wrong side of the barricade on Mysore lamps road pose a threat to the motorist who respect the law and drive on the correct side of the road  What is more alarming and ironical is that this chaos happens every day right in front of the Traffic police station  
I my self have got my heart in my mouth a couple of times here when large BMTC buses suddenly appear in front of me  Over which   I have heard abuses from those who break the law 
Local police either sound helpless or absent or unwilling to help  Yesterday  when I met with one more such threat and walked into the police station  all they could offer was some juice and butter milk  but nothing that could solve the menace 
I could not take any pictures for evidence as but next time I will follow it with the pictures and videos if authorities are unconvinced about the happenings 
May I request and hope for resolution to this menace and bring back discipline on to the roads of Bangalore and the cops who should be helping us?

* No lane discipline (Eg: ITPL road)
* Corporate sponsored DIGS (Eg: Old airport road)
* Traffic signals are time based  not traffic based
* Pedestrians crossing road in Zig Zag fission 
* Unplanned U turns (& wrong side riders)
* Yellow signal means : Ride fast     (Unofficially; but true)
* Signal jumpers (where ever possible  Maximun after 9PM)

The KSRTC bus pickup point in Navrang is exactly in the Traffic signal junction  because of this  there will be huge crowd in this junction everytime because of KSRTC buses  we request the traffic police to take immediate action about this and kindly shift this unscientific KSRTC bus pickup point

?	It requires a lot of punctuality  not everyone can be on time every day  It?s like catching your school bus 
?	You need at least a minimum number of people to car pool  It?s not easy to please everyone with versatile needs  Members of carpool tend to spend more on their group bonding like weekend get together  tea party etc?
?	It might be difficult to adjust with people in the car  in case they have peculiar habits such as smoking  music genres  or latecomers  talking on phone etc 
?	You will have to sacrifice a certain amount of independence and personal ownership of time while carpooling 
?	As there are a number of people traveling together in the car  you are prone to catch seasonal viruses easily 
?	When carpooling with companions from the same organization  it often results in a lot of gossips  backbiting and unpleasant experience for most of the people 
?	Emergencies   If there was a family emergency and you didn t drive to work  you d have to take a Taxi or get a ride  as you will have to leave for work immediately when the person picks you up  Also  you will be unable to divert your route  since you are totally dependent on that person 
?	If you love driving  you won?t be happy to become a driver for others  it?s your car and your money  The luxury and comfort might not be same in all the cars  You need to compromise with worse seat sometimes ?#+@2013 02 27T10:21:49+0000Dear Sir?#+@2013 03 07T12:27:00+0000Dear Sir  I was taking a left turn at the Hosa Road junction about 10 minutes back  The signal was green  When I crossed the main road and was trying to cross the service road to go on the Hosa Road (the light was still green) the 2 Traffic police standing there allowed two wheelers  cars  buses on the service road to go ahead on the hosur road towards the city  You may note that your department has debarred buses to ply on the service road  And here the traffic police themselves were allowing them to even break the traffic rules  When i asked the 2 policemen why they are doing this both of them replied that it was as per the existing traffic rules  When I asked them to give me the details of their officers so that i could go and talk to them  they promptly took my cars photograph  When I asked them why were they taking my car s photograph  one of them pulled out his personal mobile phone and also took my photograph  It is just for your information only ?#+@2013 03 07T12:33:57+0000"

The question is not about few bucks here  Question I m asking to BTP is how do we stop this menace  He has done this with us  and he will keep taking police and system for granted  if we do not stop such elements of society  with  some  punishment as deterrent for future

Please do reply to my question mentioned below 

 Is it legal to hit the cars or driver of the car with the Helmete use to wear by Trafic Cop???

I have seen many Trafic cops blasting the side mirrors of the cars and hitting the cars almost on every x roads of Hyderabad 
My question to you is it legal   do they really have rights to hit anyone   according to me they are doing a kind of man handling wearing trafic cop dress

Wish to meet the Traffic police dept head and talk on various issues regarding traffic movement and try to help them best way I can  Admin can you help out in this thing??#+@2013 12 13T18:29:22+0000traffic police will be at loss    they will not be able to put challans so they dont put timers as ppl will stop looking the timers   

A sincere advice  follow it and you will gain lot of popularity from me 
Instead of collecting fines/challans  educate ppl not to oversee the signal  make them realize how dangerous it can be for them and their family  5 10 min late will not cause any damage but overcrossing the signal can be a permanent damage and educate them softly/politely like their brothers/family members and see the difference

One of the major reasons causing traffic jams and accidents on flyovers especially from Sec bad  SD Road   from St  Anns  then Paradise  and begumpet are the heavy 4 wheelers   trucks  lorries n busses  these flyovers are narrow with dividers   This afternoon a truck drove over the SD road flyover and created traffic jam on the following flyover as well   and then a matador van hit my car from behind without noticing the jam ahead   which led to another jam   so  who is careless in first place?

Lets say you are on Highway bypass road (road with out divider)  Driving a car  and at your back  I m  flashing my car headlights for a space to overtake you  but you are seeing danger ahead  ( like    unsual animal crossing  or inconsistent road  or vehicle front is causing danger) 

 Question is how will you indicate me to be patient or make me calm ? ( keep in mind that your car itself is speeding on 80km/ph)  ?#+@2013 11 16T15:13:15+0000"

Assume I bought a vehicle from a person  The previous owner had some pending challans to be paid to Traffic Police  But  nowthat the vehicle is with me  am I responsible for paying this fine  or the previous owner still have the liability to pay the fine(legally)??#+@2013 10 11T06:37:54+0000It is sad that the law enforcing officers are spreading mis information and fear among citizens   I see this is a clear abuse of authority by our friendly police force  Forcing people to pay the challan is illegal and vehicles cannot be detained for not paying the challans    period    it is only if the accused (owner or driver of the vehicle) is willing to do so (i e pay the challan) then the police officer can take the payment    I repeat  the law does not give such powers to any police officers    I have utmost respect for Mr Garg Addl DP but this is plain wrong    Read below and validate it yourself     

[I am filing the writ petition in a week or so against this practice    Check out my facebook page group for the same ]

Here is the related laws: 
CMV Act S 130(3)                and if any or all of the certificates or the permit are not in his possession  he shall  within fifteen days from the date of demand  submit photo copies of the same  duly attested in person or send the same by registered post the officer who demanded it  

Similarly  the pollution check certificate need not carried at all times as per CMV Rule S 116   This section enables the police to direct the checking for pollution and thereafter we have 7 days to produce pollution certificate at the concerned police stations  You can download both the Central Motor Vehicle Act and Central Motor Vehicle Rules from internet and check it yourself 

Further here is what the supreme court said as to when a police officer gets jurisdiction to compound the challan: http://indiankanoon org/doc/1586049/
 It is not mandatory that the authorized officer would always compound the offence  It is conditional upon the willingness of the accused to have the offences compounded  It may also be done before the institution of the prosecution case  In the event of the petitioner s willing to have the offence compounded  the authorized officer gets jurisdiction and authority to compound the offence and call upon the accused to pay the same  

Further all challans older than 6 months are void by law  Take a look at section 468 of CrPC  It clearly puts the bar and even a court cannot take cognizance of such challans after 6 months  So  you need not pay older challans  The correct procedure is for the police to submit the challans in the court and allow court to process the case or if the accused voluntarily wants to pay the challan then compound the same  For detail process see this http://indiankanoon org/doc/1884626/ where a High Court has captured the same in detail 

Thus  it is hard to fathom that our friendly traffic police department knows what is right in this case better than the Hon ble Supreme and High Courts  I would request the police officers to stop mis informing the public for their convenience and instead educate citizens of their rights    Hope this is useful to the common man  ?#+@2013 10 17T15:49:39+0000Unacceptable
Its hectic and spoil the whole day Register challan and let him go without paying Make rules to force him to pay the same within a fix time If he exceeds an fixed amount or fixed time ir fixed number of challans than be harsh on him ?#+@2013 10 11T06:33:36+0000"

"27722","Dear HTP
I have been issued a challan by traffic police of vanasthalipuram PS for triple riding  I was picking up my nephews from school which is aproxmately 800 meters away frm home at autonagar  hayatnagar  hyd  I was stopped at a red signal and traffic police took my bike keys in the middle of the road  I had to push my bike to park road side on highway at green signal 
Anyway when i went to SI to explain he told me to pay 500 rupees  I requested him to pay 100 as it is minor offence  While i was questioning abt rules SI took it as offence and slapped with 1200 rs  Fine booked under 184 section  i begged him to pay fine later at e challan as i dont have enough money with me  He threatened me that he will pull away my bike with aparking truck as i couldnt afford that as i am with children  i paid all the money which i have kept for goods purchasing 
Kindly inform me with answer to following questions
1) what is the fine for first offence of triple riding 
2) is it questioning SI on rules is considered as breaking of law 
3)  fine can be payable later or not?
4) finally i dont understand booking under 184 section with Rs  1200 when it is only triple riding with children  how can tat be serious dangerous driving   even so it says only Rs 1000 fine he charged me with 1200 
5) who will answer my humiliation and abuse before my nephews as i requested to pay later at eseva  I will attach challan with this mail  All i did was questioning SI on rules and payment options  for that he slapped wih 1200 fine and changed challan reciept from 500  He literally stripped me off all the money i have in my pocket 
Iam kindly requesting you to look into this matter  Im asking all this questions because i dont have a clue abt these fines and payments let alone behavior of traffic police  I am kindly requesting you to look into this matter  

Thank you

I have one question for you   if I am caught by any  traffic police without license or RC in original form and am levied fine of 1000 then if I submit my license or RC  original  next day at Police station along with my penalty levied chalan   will the imposed penalty on me can be cancelled  How can i get my money back ?

Do i need to pay the imposed penalty chalan on the spot   or can i pay them at any other place including online payment  

What would be refund process of  paid penalty    if I fail to show Original RC or license on the spot  but  i can submit them in next day

Why don t they enforce simple common sense rules?

"42557","What An Idea Sirji  BULLSHIT F#@$@^#

One of the worst telecommunication companies in the world  I live in the Gulf  I had taken an Idea postpaid sim card number in Mumbai in 2011  The number has been used by my son in India from the very start  After a few weeks i decided to make some changes in the postpaid plans  That time they told me you have to wait for 3 months  After 3 months they screwed up an application i had submitted to them for safe custody wherein my number would be disconnected temporarily and i would only get a bill of 50 RS per month  After approx  7 months i still got my past bill when i found that they never put my number on safe custody  Then when i sent my son to change the plans  they said id have to wait 4 months because  i put  my number on safe custody  After that time period i got fed up of this service and told my son to disconnect the number forever  They said that i have to be present in India to disconnect it  

This year i personally went to India for the same work and at that time i personally went and changed the plans for my number and paid the bill 
After returning to the gulf in 6 days  i kept my number off for 3 and a half month but this bikhari company has still sent me a big bill even though my number was off  Now my son is using the number but he cannot call or send any sms to anyone  even locally  When i called customer care to know why this has happened the fools sitting over there were asking me foolish question if i had taken the number from Gujarat or Goa or Maharashtra  Are they really that illiterate? Then i told them that i bought it from Mumbai  Then they told me they have no records of my sim number  What the Hell ? Now i have been calling customer Care for over a week and whenever i call they say that their so called  system  is being updated  UPDATING THEIR SYSTEM FOR OVER A WEEK  Are they that slow being such a big company? I have sent them emails twice regarding my problem  At both times they replied saying that they tried to make contact with my number on 16th July 2013 and 20th July 2013  Today but their connection could not be established  This is Crap  I phoned my son and he says there have been no calls and that his phone is on all the time 

I want to hire a lawyer who can fight for me against Idea for the above case as I want to reimbursed what I spent in the air tickets  over charge for the packages and day by day calling charges from the gulf  I have already spent over Rs 100 000/  till now  
If you have any shame left  which I seriously doubt then do co operate with me

9811111404 ?#+@2013 07 20T08:15:21+0000I think Idea is one of the cheater service provider telecom company really in my whole life i never seen this kind of case  one month back i purchase one postpaid connection by an Idea candidate he provide me no 9911071988 & i pay him 300 Rs  he told me it will be activate within 1 week  after fifteen days i complain than again he call me & again provide me another no 7840071988 he promise that it will be activated within 1 hour  it is today after 15 days  it is still not activated  really such a looser performance shown by Idea  Now I make sure  will go consumer court

Share this with EVERYONE  

Well     try this   if u want o get your life changed     

Step 1:  get  a LOOP Mobile Connection
Step 2 : Buy an Android phone with 3G
Step 3: Realise that LOOP doesnt have 3G and kick yourself 
Step 4: Call other cellphone operators and find out who has the cheapest 3G plans in the market  Idea  
Step 5: Port out number into Idea  and enjoy 3G    

Here is where our little story takes a twist 

Step7: Loop mobile calls u that Rs 300 of your bill are pending  (you don t receive any bill for the same )  and Idea Cellular guys message you to pay the bill by 30th of April to avoid disconnection and provide them the receipt number  

Step 8: You do the same on the 29th of April  Speak to a lady named Swati Yadav from Idea and give her the Receipt number  She expressly tells you that now you dont need to go to the idea gallery with the reciept and your phone wont get disconnected 

Step8: Your phone still gets disconnected despite of paying up well with the deadline  Call the helpline from someone elses phone and they ask you to go to the My Idea outlet  

 Its 1st of May so u ask them that its Maharashtra Day would the outlet e open to which they assure you that it will be open  

Step 9:  You go to 3 outlets and find out that they all are shut  Call the idea guys again and they say that today they are shut   We apologize to you for what the previous guys told you 

HOW IS THIS SHORT OF MENTAL TORTURE    

Step10: on 2nd May: 
Go to the MY IDEA Lower Parel Outlet: 
The guy says     your number has gone back to Airtel (my earliest service provider) we cant do anything about it   

You tell them that your bank accounts  business clients and everyone has this number and you are incurring a daily loss when they can t contact you  To no avail  

Go to MY IDEA  Cumballa Hill Outlet: 

The guy says your number has gone back to Loop Mobile

Go to  Loop Mobile Outlet: 

The guy says   your number is with Idea only     just go to the gallery he will start it for you in 2 hours  If he doesnt understand make him speak to me   here is my number  

(THE LOOP GUY GIVES ME HIS NUMBER SUPER SERVICE  ) 

Go to MY IDEA Dhobi Talao: 

The guy says u gotta apply for the number again  since its disconnected   submit your papers and photo 

So thats what you do  and he asks you to wait for 7 days  (FOR NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN  ) 

MEANWHILE YOU KEEP INCURRING A LOSS AS ITS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GIVE ALL YOUR CLIENTS YOUR NEW NUMBER AND YOUR BANK AND OTHER SERVICE ACCOUNTS   

STEP 10: Follow up with the Dhobi Talao Guy   named MANIK and KETAN     they keep saying we have mailed and forwarded your request to our boss  Ask him to call his boss    they call some guy named ROHAN   You sepak to ROHAN from Idea who is their boss   he assures u that your phone will be activated on Monday  (9th Day from the document submission)

STEP 11: Call MANIK       first time call waiting   he never calls back    try again and he tells you he is in training and he will message you a number to follow up 
The message never comes and he doesnt answer his phone after that   

(TALK ABOUT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY)

Step 12: You visit the Dhobi Talao Gallery  meet KETAN  and 
tell him about MANIK not giving u the number he said he would  He gives you some shady reason of how Manik  is in a meeting  he reluctantly calls ROHAN  says that we will come to know tomorrow about the status   

Step 13: Try calling the Idea Appellate AMIT DIMRI  but the phone is ALWAYS SWITCHED OFF     He is like a non existant entity 

10 days into waiting and i have no choice now but to write this to warn all you guys of how a mismanaged company like IDEA CELLULAR can change your life  Make your customer feel like a beggar    Lie about how the MY IDEA shops will be open on 1st of May  

THIS HUGE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY THOROUGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND LYING PEOPLE   CARRYING ON LIKE THIS THEY ARE GONNA SHUT DOWN    PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE MENTAL TORTURE AND BUSINESS LOSSES ?#+@2013 05 13T14:43:46+0000I like it?#+@2013 05 13T17:28:40+0000Attention please

Hi customer care team  
I purchased a 3G Net Setter on 3rd may?13 from Vardhaman Mobile Shoppee in New Sangvi (dealer for mobiles)Pune on 3rd may?13( Thursday) and was told the connection would be active after I receive a call from IDEA for a back ground check team  and I paid 1800/  for USB stick and a 5 GB recharge which I was told is mandatory the first time  Anyway I pad all this and waited   but no call came  
I went to the dealer on  Friday and Saturday and he said it would be done on Monday evening( 6th May?13)   it?s today 11th May?13 (Saturday) and not been activated yet even after 9 days 
I spoke to customer service 3 times  Through the USIM number I got the mobile number  880 544 3844   I don?t know what to do  

There is an LBT strike now on  And shops are closed  Customer service tells me only the dealer can top up my 3G net setter for the amount I paid and to wait till strike is over  They also tell me my connection is active  
How did it get active when I didn?t receive any call ? Puts a question on security procedures 

I?m a heart patient and need the internet connection for work purposes  I am helpless without it

Share this with EVERYONE  

Well     try this   if u want o get your life changed     

Step 1:  get  a LOOP Mobile Connection
Step 2 : Buy an Android phone with 3G
Step 3: Realise that LOOP doesnt have 3G and kick yourself 
Step 4: Call other cellphone operators and find out who has the cheapest 3G plans in the market  Idea  
Step 5: Port out number into Idea  and enjoy 3G    

Here is where our little story takes a twist 

Step7: Loop mobile calls u that Rs 300 of your bill are pending  (you don t receive any bill for the same )  and Idea Cellular guys message you to pay the bill by 30th of April to avoid disconnection and provide them the receipt number  

Step 8: You do the same on the 29th of April  Speak to a lady named Swati Yadav from Idea and give her the Receipt number  She expressly tells you that now you dont need to go to the idea gallery with the reciept and your phone wont get disconnected 

Step8: Your phone still gets disconnected despite of paying up well with the deadline  Call the helpline from someone elses phone and they ask you to go to the My Idea outlet  

 Its 1st of May so u ask them that its Maharashtra Day would the outlet e open to which they assure you that it will be open  

Step 9:  You go to 3 outlets and find out that they all are shut  Call the idea guys again and they say that today they are shut   We apologize to you for what the previous guys told you 

HOW IS THIS SHORT OF MENTAL TORTURE    

Step10: on 2nd May: 
Go to the MY IDEA Lower Parel Outlet: 
The guy says     your number has gone back to Airtel (my earliest service provider) we cant do anything about it   

You tell them that your bank accounts  business clients and everyone has this number and you are incurring a daily loss when they can t contact you  To no avail  

Go to MY IDEA  Cumballa Hill Outlet: 

The guy says your number has gone back to Loop Mobile

Go to  Loop Mobile Outlet: 

The guy says   your number is with Idea only     just go to the gallery he will start it for you in 2 hours  If he doesnt understand make him speak to me   here is my number  

(THE LOOP GUY GIVES ME HIS NUMBER SUPER SERVICE  ) 

Go to MY IDEA Dhobi Talao: 

The guy says u gotta apply for the number again  since its disconnected   submit your papers and photo 

So thats what you do  and he asks you to wait for 7 days  (FOR NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN  ) 

MEANWHILE YOU KEEP INCURRING A LOSS AS ITS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GIVE ALL YOUR CLIENTS YOUR NEW NUMBER AND YOUR BANK AND OTHER SERVICE ACCOUNTS   

STEP 10: Follow up with the Dhobi Talao Guy   named MANIK and KETAN     they keep saying we have mailed and forwarded your request to our boss  Ask him to call his boss    they call some guy named ROHAN   You sepak to ROHAN from Idea who is their boss   he assures u that your phone will be activated on Monday  (9th Day from the document submission)

STEP 11: Call MANIK       first time call waiting   he never calls back    try again and he tells you he is in training and he will message you a number to follow up 
The message never comes and he doesnt answer his phone after that   

(TALK ABOUT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY)

Step 12: You visit the Dhobi Talao Gallery  meet KETAN  and 
tell him about MANIK not giving u the number he said he would  He gives you some shady reason of how Manik  is in a meeting  he reluctantly calls ROHAN  says that we will come to know tomorrow about the status   

Step 13: Try calling the Idea Appellate AMIT DIMRI  but the phone is ALWAYS SWITCHED OFF     He is like a non existant entity

This is very very careful notice for everyone 

In telecom sector all networks are bad but the worst network provider is idea so if you are going to have an idea xonnection don t waste your money and time on it bcoz after two datys you will weep to have this network as I m so be carefull about it and share this as much as possible so that you can save someone  s time and money

I m fed up with this network and would be more happy without a phone rather than having such network

When I called idea care on the same day(03/05/2013)  they said they cannot register a complaint as videos were downloaded  as per their system 

I just googled  xinlabs idea  and found that hundreds of Idea customers had faced the same problem  

Rs  50 is not a big amount  I agree  But  what makes me concerned here is  you are charging hundreds of customer for services you never provide 
Apparently you are not bother about this generic problem because it makes you earn a lot of money  What an idea sir ji 

This is really not fair 

What the hell this XINLABS is?
Please consider shutting it down  looking at hundreds of complaints 

I expect you to refund my money as soon as possible

Share this with EVERYONE  

Well     try this   if u want o get your life changed     

Step 1:  get  a LOOP Mobile Connection
Step 2 : Buy an Android phone with 3G
Step 3: Realise that LOOP doesnt have 3G and kick yourself 
Step 4: Call other cellphone operators and find out who has the cheapest 3G plans in the market  Idea  
Step 5: Port out number into Idea  and enjoy 3G    

Here is where our little story takes a twist 

Step7: Loop mobile calls u that Rs 300 of your bill are pending  (you don t receive any bill for the same )  and Idea Cellular guys message you to pay the bill by 30th of April to avoid disconnection and provide them the receipt number  

Step 8: You do the same on the 29th of April  Speak to a lady named Swati Yadav from Idea and give her the Receipt number  She expressly tells you that now you dont need to go to the idea gallery with the reciept and your phone wont get disconnected 

Step8: Your phone still gets disconnected despite of paying up well with the deadline  Call the helpline from someone elses phone and they ask you to go to the My Idea outlet  

 Its 1st of May so u ask them that its Maharashtra Day would the outlet e open to which they assure you that it will be open  

Step 9:  You go to 3 outlets and find out that they all are shut  Call the idea guys again and they say that today they are shut   We apologize to you for what the previous guys told you 

HOW IS THIS SHORT OF MENTAL TORTURE    

Step10: on 2nd May: 
Go to the MY IDEA Lower Parel Outlet: 
The guy says     your number has gone back to Airtel (my earliest service provider) we cant do anything about it   

You tell them that your bank accounts  business clients and everyone has this number and you are incurring a daily loss when they can t contact you  To no avail  

Go to MY IDEA  Cumballa Hill Outlet: 

The guy says your number has gone back to Loop Mobile

Go to  Loop Mobile Outlet: 

The guy says   your number is with Idea only     just go to the gallery he will start it for you in 2 hours  If he doesnt understand make him speak to me   here is my number  

(THE LOOP GUY GIVES ME HIS NUMBER SUPER SERVICE  ) 

Go to MY IDEA Dhobi Talao: 

The guy says u gotta apply for the number again  since its disconnected   submit your papers and photo 

So thats what you do  and he asks you to wait for 7 days  (FOR NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN  ) 

MEANWHILE YOU KEEP INCURRING A LOSS AS ITS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GIVE ALL YOUR CLIENTS YOUR NEW NUMBER AND YOUR BANK AND OTHER SERVICE ACCOUNTS   

STEP 10: Follow up with the Dhobi Talao Guy   named MANIK and KETAN     they keep saying we have mailed and forwarded your request to our boss  Ask him to call his boss    they call some guy named ROHAN   You sepak to ROHAN from Idea who is their boss   he assures u that your phone will be activated on Monday  (9th Day from the document submission)

STEP 11: Call MANIK       first time call waiting   he never calls back    try again and he tells you he is in training and he will message you a number to follow up 
The message never comes and he doesnt answer his phone after that   

(TALK ABOUT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY)

Step 12: You visit the Dhobi Talao Gallery  meet KETAN  and 
tell him about MANIK not giving u the number he said he would  He gives you some shady reason of how Manik  is in a meeting  he reluctantly calls ROHAN  says that we will come to know tomorrow about the status   

Step 13: Try calling the Idea Appellate AMIT DIMRI  but the phone is ALWAYS SWITCHED OFF     He is like a non existant entity 

10 days into waiting and i have no choice now but to write this to warn all you guys of how a mismanaged company like IDEA CELLULAR can change your life  Make your customer feel like a beggar    Lie about how the MY IDEA shops will be open on 1st of May  

THIS HUGE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY THOROUGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND LYING PEOPLE   CARRYING ON LIKE THIS THEY ARE GONNA SHUT DOWN    PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE MENTAL TORTURE AND BUSINESS LOSSES ?#+@2013 05 13T15:30:09+0000"

this is in refrence to my mobile no 9920818111 which was my vodafone number from last 5 years got mnp done to idea because of the very good plans  i stay in vasai even my billing is the same address and i am being charged roaming for the same  where as per the super value plan 1599 i was in formed that 10000 LOCAL/STD/ROAMING MINUTES ARE FREE AND 8 GB DATA  
can you please answer these following questions in simple
1) why my billing address which comes under maharshtra i put in another circle 
2) when you say roaming minutes free what the meaning of that
3) when i spoke to Miss Rajani Bhardwaj to explan these same issues she diconnected the call in ongoing coversation 
4) i was promised the services that i am enjoying vodafone same would be activated in idea where isd is not provided to me 

please sought my issues and reply for same  other wise i will have to go back to my earlier operator vodafone as there is afalse commitments from idea 
thanking you

Instead you converted my plan to a 2G connection  Remaining amount on my connection they have added a few amount into my account  To my surprise I was told I cannot opt for a call charge reduction and I am getting deducted Rs 6 for every phone call I make 

?	I opted for a 3 G connection and you sold the services for 3G  
?	I never wanted 2G and you converted my plan to 2G and this is of no use to me 
?	I am not provided an option for a reduced call charge 
?	I am being charged Rs 6 for every minute I use which was at the time of mobile phone launch
I hope you have understood my issue and request you to take action on my complaint

on 2013 jan 12th i called to customer care for 1 gb plan internet rs   99   and i talked about pro rental basis also  even i asked about pro rental they did not tell exactly details 
then they told the service will start on next working day  i think on jan 14th service started so i started browsing but bill came more then i called to customer care but they replied as that the plan was activated was zero rental plan     i complained lot of times but problem not solved   finally i called on jan 21st to care then they answered as the problem solved   but on feb 9th my bill came more   gprs bill 1500 + tax     this is purely customer care problem so deduct the amount from my bill and actual i gb plan bill to my bill   recently my cell outgoing barred    if service to cell (and clearance on my bill) not started in 24 hours i will start legal actions     try to solve my problem as early as possible  
on 2012 oct 31 st i called to customer care for 1 gb internet plan  at that time they did not explain me about pro rental basis   at taht time i dont know about it   i started internet but the bill came more     in bill for data rs  1128 + 28+tax    this time also i paid unnecessarily 1128 + tax because of customer care improper information  

in the year 2010 i took 3 sims post paid 9912049991  9912049993 9912049998  
inthis last 2 nos i converted to prepaid    9912049993     when i recharged to this balance automatically debitted   i complained a lot of times at that time also problem not solved    finally this 2 prepaid nos i did not used because of customer care    

I COMPLAINED NO OF TIMES TO IDEA CELLULAR BUT THE PROBLEM NIT SOLVED  
NOW THEY STOPPED SMS AND OUTGOING CALL SERVICES TO MY NO 
PLEASE take serious actions on IDEA /customer care executives

I have subscribed for 3G net Tata Docomo  But  net gets disconnected after each 40 minutes for 20 minutes 

So  I called your helpline number 198 just now  And their response was next to pathetic  The Customer Care informed me that it is the TATA Docomo s policy to disconnect 3G Internet after 40 minutes of usage for next 20 minutes 

No other service providers has this type of policy  Don t you think
that this is self destructing policy?

Please let me know if it is true what your customer care personnel has told me 

Don t you think that the end users need the uninterrupted internet
service for their work??#+@2013 11 23T15:20:37+0000Tata DoCoMo the worst network?#+@2013 11 23T07:46:07+0000"

I have few questions and complaints about the number portability 

1  Is it possible to convert my tata indicom cdma prepaid mobile number into docomo prepaid ? Because I have been told by your customer care center that its not possible at all to convert number into prepaid services 

2  What are the number portability charges? I have been charges for Rs 150 for new sim and number portability  Where your website clearly says  The refreshingly differentland of Tata DOCOMO is just 3 simple steps away  An SMS  a few documents and maximum of 7 days is all it takes for you to come aboard the Tata DOCOMO bandwagon  Switching to Tata DOCOMO will not cause any service interruptions and costs only Rs 19  

3  I have tried to reset password to login to tata docomo account and got message as  As per your request  your Password is now reset for Tata Docomo DEL ******9935  pin has been sent to your mobile  Whereever I never ever received the PIN

So far no response  Very sad that even Tata s concern uses the same unreliable protocol towards customers  Almost a month gone  still they are nt able to figure out the issue  Guess  even a new born baby wont believe their commitment

After getting the recharge i also got a confirmation msg on my mobile which said that the recharge is successful 
However upon using the data on my mobile  the money kept getting deducted from my Talk value and there was no Data Value which was provided to me 
The surprise is that since yesterday i have lost almost INR 150 from my balance for Data usage 
I tried reaching the customer care no but could not connect to them entire evening (yesterday)  Today when i contact your chat support  they tell me that the issue will be resolved by 17th Oct 
Would request someone to please take care of the issue and help me with this ASAP 
Thanks

So far no response  Very sad that even Tata s concern uses the same unreliable protocol towards customers  Almost a month gone  still they are nt able to figure out the issue  Guess  even a new born baby wont believe their commitment

first u have told me that we will refund full 252/  then why u r not following ur statement      

thats docomo fault thats not my fault

according to docomo i have still 4 mb data in my account      

thats ur computer mistake      

i want my money back  

 why i will pay 252/  for only 10 mb data

i can get 600mb in 90rs then why i will get 10 mb in 252/ 

plz accept ur fault and refund me my money   

if u can not pay 152/  pending amount then plz refund only 100 rs more to me

	It is unpleasant for me to inform you that even if our locality is very close to both the towns having 3G network connection ( i e  Digboi n Margherita )  but also  we are being unable to use the 3G network facility in our locality i e  powai and its surrounding area 
	So therefore  we would be very thankful to you if you kindly arrange to provide us the 3G facility with good network connection at our locality  if possible 
	This is thus a request for your favour and necessary action

Hi I bought an aircel postpaid plan with their iPhone bundled offer in 2012   no 8898017235 
In Feb 2013 as I was not satisfied with their network I decided to stop the service
But I got numerous calls by their customer retention agents and finally I was changed to Mumbai 50 plan with 500mns free
The agent at that time told me that plan is for 6 months and after that it will b auto renewed   Inspire of that assurance I rechecked In July at der cc regarding my plan   I was assured that the plan remains the same   The unbilled amount also was showing as per plan
Then at d time of Bill generation I was given at inflated bill of 689 Rs where a 500 mins free deduction was not done
In spite of repeated complaints total 5 in all of which was agreed by their cc agents der was no solution 
And Dey remained adamant dat d bill is correct 
Dey discontinued my service and hav now 
Sent me an email threatening legal action
Hence I have decided not to give into their pressure tactics and will fight it out in d consumer court if need be
I am ready to pay my bills if given disount as per my plan
But I m not goin to pay xtra unlawful bill   
Hence if this complaint does not get a proper response I am going to a case in the consumer forum against aircel?#+@2013 10 07T18:02:31+0000i lyk it ?#+@2013 10 07T08:54:18+0000Very fast?#+@2013 10 07T06:11:43+0000Db9 for roket?#+@2013 10 07T05:58:17+0000Fast And Furious?#+@2013 10 07T05:54:00+0000"

With great dissatisfaction I am writing this mail to you that today I have been charged 25 rupees against the mobile number mentioned on subject  During the  surprise I called up to the helpline and have a discussion with Deepak and he have informed me that I have been charged for video download from aircel store  When I request him to return the amount he strictly denied to do so and told me that it has been charged for web access so is non refundable 

For your kind information I would like to state that I have already recharged my mobile with unlimited net pack so there s no excuses that this charge has done for browsing or accessing websites 

I have not access the aircel store if the system is showing any such reports definitely that is an error for which I have charged  This is totally unprofessional against the business policy  As a valued customer I have all the right to get my money back where I have not used anything 

I have already raised a request for refunds of the charged amount  I also need a penalty for this inconvenience and mental harassment caused by you

With great dissatisfaction I am writing this mail to you that today I have been charged 25 rupees against the mobile number mentioned on subject  During the  surprise I called up to the helpline and have a discussion with Deepak and he have informed me that I have been charged for video download from aircel store  When I request him to return the amount he strictly denied to do so and told me that it has been charged for web access so is non refundable 

For your kind information I would like to state that I have already recharged my mobile with unlimited net pack so there s no excuses that this charge has done for browsing or accessing websites 

I have not access the aircel store if the system is showing any such reports definitely that is an error for which I have charged  This is totally unprofessional against the business policy  As a valued customer I have all the right to get my money back where I have not used anything 

I have already raised a request for refunds of the charged amount  I also need a penalty for this inconvenience and mental harassment caused by you

I have been using Aircel for the last 2years almost  Few days ago I recharged my number (8802049171 Delhi Circle) with the tariff plan of RS18 for ISD calling  after few hours I recharged my number with Rs38 STD tariff plan that why ISD tariff got deactivated  after some hours I recharged my number with Rs 18 again to activate ISD tariff because I need it more than the STD tariff  But it wasn?t working  I called your customer care  They said after 30days only the ISD tariff can be activated  I advised them about my urgency so they told me that I will not take less than 7days to undone the effect of STD tariff and to activate ISD tariff  I requested them to sort it out as quick as possible  They said ok fine  it would be done in 24hours  
Since then it?s been about a week  neither the problem is resolved nor I am able to connect with Aircel Customer Care  while the customer care calls from other numbers are being accepted 
Seems  My number has been disabled to connect with CC  May I please know the reason more over I also would like my issue to be resolved on urgent basis

"54241","Thank you all for your comments ?#+@2013 10 09T08:26:57+0000HOW TO EAT FRUITS? ??????????????

We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits  cutting it and just popping it into our mouths  It s not as easy as you think 
It s important to know how and when to eat 

DON T EAT FRUIT AFTER MEALS  

FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH  

It will play a major role to detoxify your system  supplying a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities  

FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD  Let s say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit  The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines  but it is prevented from doing so  

In the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid  The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices  the entire mass of food begins to spoil     

Eat fruit on an empty stomach or before meals  People complain   Every time I eat watermelon I burp; when I eat apples  my stomach bloats up; when I eat a banana? I feel like running to the toilet  etc ? This will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach  Fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and produces gas  hence you will bloat  

Grey hair  balding  nervous outburst  and dark circles under eyes will NOT happen by taking fruit on an empty stomach  

There is no such thing as some fruits  like orange and lemon ?are acidic  because all fruits become alkaline in our body  according to Dr  Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter  Master the correct way of eating fruits  and you will  have beauty  longevity  health  energy  happiness and normal weight  

Drink only fresh fruit juice ? NOT from the cans  Don t even drink juice that has been heated up  Don t eat cooked fruits because you don t get the nutrients at all  Cooking destroys all the vitamins  

Eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice  If you should drink the juice  drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly  because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it  You can go on a 3 day fruit fast to cleanse your body  Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look  

KIWI: ?A good source of potassium  magnesium  vitamin E & fiber  Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange  

APPLE: ?Although an apple has a low vitamin C content  it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower risks of colon cancer  heart attack & stroke  

STRAWBERRY:  ?   have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect from cancer causing  blood vessel clogging free radicals 

ORANGE :?  Taking 2 4 oranges a day may help keep colds away  lower cholesterol  prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessening the risk of colon cancer  

WATERMELON:?  Composed of 92% water  it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione  which helps boost our immune system  A key source of lycopene  the cancer fighting oxidant  Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium  

GUAVA & PAPAYA: ? for their high vitamin C content  Guava is also rich in fiber  which helps prevent constipation  Papaya is rich in carotene; good for your eyes  

Drinking Cold water after meals = Cancer 

It will solidify the oily stuff you have just consumed and  slow down digestion    Once this  sludge  reacts with the acid  it will break down and be absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food  It will line the intestine  This will turn into fats and lead to cancer  Better to drink hot soup or warm water after a meal  

HEART ATTACK PROCEDURE : Not every heart attack symptom is going to be the left arm hurting  Be aware of pain in the jaw line  You may never have chest pain during a heart attack  Nausea and intense sweating are common symptoms  Sixty percent who have an attack while asleep do not wake up  Pain in the jaw can awaken you

Yogurt is formed by the bacterial fermentation of milk  It can be made from any milk  but cows milk is usually used  Bacteria cause the sugar in the milk to ferment  that produces lactic acid  This then reacts with the protein in the milk to form yogurt 
100 grams of yogurt  contains 10 billion live bacteria  Human body needs to have a healthy amount of   good   bacteria in the digestive tract  and many yogurts are made using active  good bacteria

"54610","Kidney stones are more prevalent in the summer since they are linked to water intake  Those high temperatures that make swimming at the beach so much fun tend to make the body lose more water than normal 

Many people don?t drink enough fluids to compensate for the warmer temperatures or they drink fluids that work against the body s need for fluids?such as beer  colas and coffee 

Drink enough water  at least four to eight glasses a day  and double that in hot weather  Stay away from those ice cold beers and other alcoholic concoctions   drinks that tend to make you lose more water ?#+@2013 05 28T09:51:53+0000"

"59817","Apollo hospital Bhubaneswar is one of the worst hospital to take your patients to survive  The nurses are the worst and fresh out of college  They are insensitive to patients  Patients even get injured without being attended properly in icu  In emergency one such nurse did not even know which tube to remove before transferring the patient to ICU  she removed oxygen tube from cylinder  In emergency  there are group of young doctors in blue dress  who take alcohol in the night behind the emergency block  There is one doctor who is so casual that he is even giving sarcastic comments about patients 
I ve already circulated to hundreds of my friends and colleagues not to visit this hospital ever  And same will be circulated through social media  twitters  change org campaign 
Apollo hospitals don t even share the medical test results  reports of the patients  They do everything secretly without taking any consent from close relatives of patient 

You must change your policy to share the medical records with patients and their families  Also sentitise the doctors  nurses  other hospital staffs  You are in a noble profession and SAVING LIVES SHOULD BE PRIORITY THAN MINTING MONEY FROM PATIENTS 

Fire those nurses and doctors who can not live upto the vision and mission of Apollo hospitals ?#+@2015 06 16T00:57:43+0000will u adopt me I Want to work for patients?#+@2013 11 12T15:58:33+0000did apollo sack the urologist DR T K MAITRA&his operator R Biswas frm Apollo clinic  Gariahat  kolkata?

"59935","Dear Mansukh & DrPragatee 

Treatment for vertigo depends on its cause  In many cases  vertigo goes away without any treatment  This is because your brain is able to adapt  at least in part  to the inner ear changes  relying on other mechanisms to maintain balance 

In some cases  treatment is needed and may include:

? Vestibular rehabilitation: This is a type of physical therapy which helps in strengthening the vestibular system  The function of the vestibular system is to send signals to the brain about head and body movements relative to gravity  if you have recurrent bouts of vertigo vestibular rehab may be recommended  It helps train your other senses to compensate for vertigo 

? Medicine: In some cases  medication may be given to relieve symptoms such as nausea or motion sickness associated with vertigo  If vertigo is caused by an infection or inflammation  antibiotics or steroids may reduce swelling and cure infection   
 For Meniere s disease  diuretics (water pills) may be prescribed to reduce pressure from fluid buildup 

? Surgery: In a few cases  surgery may be needed for vertigo 
If vertigo is caused by a more serious underlying problem  such as a tumor or injury to the brain or neck  treatment for those problems often helps to alleviate the vertigo ?#+@2013 08 08T09:34:11+0000Yes many are asking what is the solution@apollo hospitals ??#+@2013 07 16T16:03:57+0000Apollo Hospitals  wats a perfect medicine fr it ??#+@2013 07 16T11:33:19+0000Thanks a lot                    ?#+@2013 08 08T10:41:48+0000Plz tell the causes??#+@2013 07 16T18:18:52+0000Precious?#+@2013 07 16T11:38:23+0000don t worry be happy    doctor saheb he koi chinta nahi?#+@2013 07 16T11:36:33+0000Consult to a doctor is essential before using any kind of medicine ?#+@2013 07 16T11:34:00+0000Thanks ?#+@2013 07 18T03:36:26+0000Don t ignore this symptom      ?#+@2013 07 16T11:35:42+0000"

"60098","Ann Wigmore introduced wheatgrass to America more than thirty years ago  In her books  Wigmore says it is an ideal food to nourish the body and rid it of toxins  It is especially important to anyone who suffers from pain or illness 
The high chlorophyll content of wheatgrass acts as a  magnet  in drawing out toxins from the body  Chlorophyll is an internal deodorant which cleanses tissues and is soothing and healing 
Chlorophyll  the  blood of plants   is very similar to our own blood  Its molecular structure closely resembles hemin  the pigment that combines with protein to form hemoglobin  
Start with just one spoon of wheatgrass powder per day  A therapeutic program may include as much as two or three ounces 
Wheatgrass Powder has many other benefits ?#+@2013 06 20T03:14:33+0000gd?#+@2013 06 19T20:32:58+0000Nice line?#+@2013 06 19T12:21:48+0000"

what is important is we need to create a system like say for example   in NDTV we have pollution watch and each city gets some ranking   we need some sort of scales to rank cities within the country   now India stands very low in World health organisation ranking for healthy indices and once we start improving each cities we improve the nation   I fact this is exactly the concept I wanted to be involved as doctor and being practising for over a decade this concept would be good to reach to the people and we need private and public participation   various issues including reach of health service to all   I am sure chennai should be proud of many hospitals and I hope it will stand first and we can have a some sort of IPL league for health delivery   health reach and people s health and happiness   I have been practicing as doctor and specialist for over a decade and I think this is another concept and each city could get a global ranking as well like comparing with cities like London  or Toronto etc ::well to end the note I think chennai will rank first   I would be surprised other wise       as I am proud chenniate

Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the covering of shoulder undergoes contracture  It happens more in diabetics but can also happen in non diabetics 
The volume of the shoulder is reduced and this results in reduced movement and can cause pain 
Treatment is firstly physiotherapy and if this does not help Key Hole surgery(arthroscopic) release can be done in resistant cases  For more information visit us at www nexusortho net?#+@2013 04 15T10:35:42+0000What is trcaycardia and how it can be cured and is it fatal?#+@2013 04 14T13:29:43+0000What is cause of frozen shoulder?#+@2013 04 16T02:35:17+0000plez plez reply soon wat it is n hw can it b cured?#+@2013 04 15T01:25:29+0000tel me frozen shoulder??????#+@2013 04 14T13:19:42+0000Hello Dr Senthil   In Mid fifties a relation has just develop the muscles of the entire arm specially the biceps of bot arms have no strength as such on sleeping on right& left sides  holding open newspaper while reading it just pains in less than 30 secs  Cannot dust with dusting cloth cannot scrub clothes with a brush or rub amongst as immediately the hands feel tired and pains special from shoulder down to the elbow the entire biceps   Also feel like pressing all the time the entire effect both hands with fingers and thumb and as such all concentration is on the hands and no where other due to no strength

"60476","Dear Gaganjeet Singh 
Shoulder pain after sporting injuries usually represent tear in the lining of the socket of shoulder This is called SLAP(Superior Labral Anteroposterior Tears)  The pain typically happens only when you r getting into throwing action or lifting things  

These can be addressed by Arthroscopic(Key Hole) repair  The diagnosis should be first confirmed by an MRI scan with contrast 
Once diagnosis is confirmed SLAP repair can be done  This has to  be carried out by a specialist shoulder surgeon experienced in these  For further information please look at www nexusortho net ?#+@2013 04 15T10:28:54+0000sir i m feeling pain in the upper part of my right shoulder _x000D_

"60491","Dear Sheshansh Shandilya 
We need to identify the cause of stiff neck and shoulder  Problems within shoulder joint like Rotator cuff problems  Acromioclavicular joint problems can lead to muscle spasm and stiffness of pain and neck  The other causes are disc prolapse  arthritis within joints of cervical spine 

To address these you need to consult a specialist shoulder surgeon and you may require further investigations like Xray/USGto rule out the above mentioned problems  Physiotherapy along with Trigger Point Injections of muscles can relieve pain and spasm ?#+@2013 04 15T10:23:49+0000Dear Dilip Inamdar 
Pain in shoulder in your case is most likely to be shoulder arthritis  This can be primary (without any underlying tendon problems) or secondary (Underlying Rotator Cuff tendon problems)  
To confirm diagnosis we need to carry out Xrays and sometimes MRI scan to identify any Rotator Cuff Tendon pathology 
If arthritis is confirmed there are now options to do shoulder replacements with excellent outcome This has to be done by an experienced shoulder surgeon 
Please look at www nexusortho net for more details ?#+@2013 04 15T10:46:16+0000How sinus can be cured??#+@2013 04 11T12:49:37+0000how can i cured neck and back pain????#+@2013 04 11T13:48:07+0000I am 72  Was doing office work  Some 30_x000D_

Sudden lifting of weights over short period of time can induce significant muscle strain /injury  This first of all requires rest and anti  inflammatories like Ibuprofen  If your symptoms continue to be an issue   u can consult us in person to rule out any significant tendon damage/muscle damage  To identify these after clinical examination we may need to order Ultrasound scan of muscle/tendons to look for inflammation/damage ?#+@2013 04 15T09:37:05+0000Dear All

The effort to overcome obesity is more likely to be successful if you follow strategies at home in addition to your formal treatment plan  These can include:
? Stick to your treatment plan  Changing a lifestyle you may have lived with for many years can be difficult  Be honest with your doctor  therapist or other health care providers if you find your activity or eating goals slipping  
? Take your medications as directed  If you take weight loss medications or medications to treat obesity related conditions  such as high blood pressure or diabetes  take them exactly as prescribed
? Learn about your condition  Education about obesity can help you learn more about why you became obese and what you can do about it  You may feel more empowered to take control and stick to your treatment plan  
? Enlist support  Get your family and friends on board with your weight loss goals  Surround yourself with people who will support you and help you  not sabotage your efforts  Make sure they understand how important weight loss is to your health  You might also want to join a weight loss support group 
? Set realistic goals  When you have to lose a significant amount of weight  you may set goals that are unrealistic  such as trying to lose too much too fast  Don t set yourself up for failure  Set daily or weekly goals for exercise and weight loss  Make small changes in your diet instead of attempting drastic changes that you re not likely to stick with for the long haul 
? Identify and avoid food triggers  Distract yourself from your desire to eat with something positive  such as calling a friend  Practice saying no to unhealthy foods and big portions  Eat when you re actually hungry ? not simply when the clock says it s time to eat 
? Keep a record  Keep a food and activity journal  This journal can help you remain accountable for your eating and exercise habits  You can discover behavior that may be holding you back and  conversely  what works well for you  You can also use the journal to track other important health parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels and overall fitness ?#+@2013 04 05T16:01:54+0000"

Simple treatments such as rest and ice often help  but sometimes physical therapy or even surgery is needed to ease patellofemoral pain  If the knee pain doesn t improve within a few days  consult your doctor  If nonsurgical treatments aren t effective  following are the measures to be undertaken:
? Arthroscopy  During this procedure  the doctor inserts an arthroscope ? a pencil thin device equipped with a camera lens and light ? into your knee through a tiny incision  Surgical instruments are passed through the arthroscope to remove fragments of damaged cartilage 
? Realignment  In more severe cases  a surgeon may need to operate on your knee to realign the angle of the kneecap or relieve pressure on the cartilage ?#+@2013 03 08T12:18:20+0000Dear Babli Pathania 
It is a general term indicating damage to the cartilage under your kneecap  The cartilage under your kneecap is a natural shock absorber  Overuse  injury or other factors may lead to this condition called chondromalacia patella  The most common symptom is knee pain that increases when you walk up or down stairs  Simple treatments such as rest and ice often help  but sometimes physical therapy or even surgery is needed to ease patellofemoral pain  If the knee pain doesn t improve within a few days  consult your doctor  If nonsurgical treatments aren t effective  following are the measures to be undertaken:
? Arthroscopy  During this procedure  the doctor inserts an arthroscope ? a pencil thin device equipped with a camera lens and light ? into your knee through a tiny incision  Surgical instruments are passed through the arthroscope to remove fragments of damaged cartilage
